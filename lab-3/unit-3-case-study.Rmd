## 1. PREPARE

The primary goal in this case study is to examine the use of different
algorithms to analyze a network's groups and individual actors. Using an
open educational dataset prepared by Kellogg and Edelman
@kellogg2015massively, we'll explore both "top-down" and "bottom-up"
approaches to identifying groups within our network, as well as
node-level measures of centrality to identify key actors. Specifically,
the Unit 3 case study will cover the following topics:

1.  **Prepare**: Prior to analysis, we'll take a look at the context
    from which our data came, formulate simple research questions to
    guide our analysis, and load some by now familiar R packages for
    network analysis.

2.  **Wrangle**: Wrangling data entails the work of manipulating,
    cleaning, transforming, and merging data. In section 2 we focus on
    importing network data, and converting edge and node lists into a
    network object that can be analyzed and graphed.

3.  **Explore**: In section 3, we look at components and cliques within
    our network, and learn how to add add summarize important node-level
    measures of centrality.

4.  **Model**: While we won't dig into approaches for modeling network
    data until Unit 4, we will take a quick look at some approaches used
    in the research article guiding this study.

5.  **Communicate**: Finally, you'll prepare a simple "data product"
    consisting of a data visualization and/or table that highlights some
    key findings from our analysis.

### 1a. Review the Research

In [Social Network Analysis and Education: Theory, Methods &
Applications](https://methods.sagepub.com/book/social-network-analysis-and-education),
Carolan (2013) notes that:

> the **social network perspective** is one concerned with the structure
> of relations and the implication this structure has on individual or
> group behavior and attitudes

More specifically, Carolan cites the following four features used by
Freeman (2004) to define the social network perspective:

1.  Social network analysis is **motivated by a relational intuition**
    based on ties connecting social actors.

2.  It is firmly **grounded in systematic empirical data**.

3.  It **makes** **use of graphic imagery** to represent actors and
    their relations with one another.

4.  It **relies** **on** **mathematical and/or computational models** to
    succinctly represent the complexity of social life.

For Unit 3, our case study is guided by previous research and evaluation
work conducted by the Friday Institute for Educational Innovation as
part of the Massively Open Online Courses for Educators (MOOC-Ed)
initiative. The study introduced next and our hands-on analysis with R
will help to illustrate these four defining features of the social
network perspective.

#### A Social Network Perspective in MOOC-Eds

![](img/irrodl-article.png){width="50%"}

Kellogg, S., Booth, S., & Oliver, K. (2014). [A social network
perspective on peer supported learning in MOOCs for
educators](https://github.com/sbkellogg/eci-589/blob/main/unit-1/lit/sna_mooc_irrodl_bjet_articles.pdf). *International
Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning*, *15*(5), 263-289.

#### Research Context

In the spring of 2013, The Friday Institute launched the MOOC-Ed
Initiative to explore the potential of delivering personalized,
high-quality professional development to educators at scale (Kleiman et
al., 2013). In collaboration with the Alliance for Excellent Education,
the Friday Institute launched this initiative with a 6-week pilot course
called Planning for the Digital Learning Transition in K-12 Schools (DLT
1), which was offered again in September 2013 (DLT 2). This course was
designed to help school and district leaders plan and implement K-12
digital learning initiatives.

Academics, as well as pundits from traditional and new media, have
raised a number of concerns about MOOCs, including the lack of
instructional and social supports. Among the core design principles of
MOOC-Eds are collaboration and peer-supported learning. It is an
assumption of this study that challenges arising form this problem of
scale can be addressed by leveraging these massive numbers to develop
robust online learning communities.

This mixed-methods case study used both SNA and qualitative methods to
better understand peer support in MOOC-Eds through an examination of the
characteristics, mechanisms, and outcomes of peer networks. Findings
from this study demonstrate that even with technology as basic as a
discussion forum, MOOCs can be leveraged to foster these networks and
facilitate peer-supported learning. Although this study was limited to
two unique cases along the wide spectrum of MOOCs, the methods applied
provide other researchers with an approach for better understanding the
dynamic process of peer supported learning in MOOCs.

#### Data Sources

**MOOC-Ed registration form.** All participants completed a registration
form for each MOOC-Ed course. The registration form consists of
self-reported demographic data, including information related to their
professional role and work setting, years of experience in education,
and personal learning goals.

**MOOC-Ed discussion forums.** All peer interaction, including peer
discussion, feedback, and reactions (e.g., likes), take place within the
forum area of MOOC-Eds, which are powered by Vanilla Forums. Because of
the specific focus on peer supported learning, postings to or from
course facilitators and staff were removed from the data set. Finally,
analyses described below exclude more passive forms of interactions
(i.e., read and reaction logs), and include only postings among peers.

For our Unit 3 case study, we'll take a look at data from the original
Digital Learning Transition in K-12 Schools (DLT 1) that was not
included in this study. **For your independent analysis next week, you
may want to consider working with the DLT 2 data to see if you can
replicate some of the findings from this paper!**

**Note**: In the data we're using, instructors have not yet been removed
and only direct replies to forum posts have been included, though
"weaker" ties like reactions with emoticons and even views of posts were
captured in this study.

### 1b. Identify a Question(s)

A Social Network Perspective on Peer Supported Learning was framed by
three primary research questions related to peer supported learning:

1.  What are the patterns of peer interaction and the structure of peer
    networks that emerge over the course of a MOOC-Ed?

2.  To what extent do participant and network attributes (e.g.,
    homophily, reciprocity, transitivity) account for the structure of
    these networks?

3.  To what extent do these networks result in the co-construction of
    new knowledge?

For Unit 3, our exploratory analysis is guided by RQ1 from the original
study with an additional emphasis on examining groups and key actors
that emerge in the discussion forums for the first and second
implementation of the Digital Learning Transition MOOC-Eds.
Specifically, for our case we're interested in the following questions
examining groups and key actors:

1.  How many network components and cliques are in first and second
    iteration of DLT 1 and DLT 2?
2.  Which actors are central to each of these networks and what
    attributes, if any, do they share?

### 1c. Load Libraries

As highlighted in [Chapter 6 of Data Science in Education Using
R](https://datascienceineducation.com/c06.html#c06p) (DSIEUR):

> Packages are shareable collections of R code that can contain
> functions, data, and/or documentation. Packages increase the
> functionality of R by providing access to additional functions to suit
> a variety of needs.

You should see installed some familiar tidytext packages from our
[Getting Started
Walkthrough](https://sbkellogg.github.io/eci-589/unit-0/unit-0-walkthrough.html)
like {dplyr} and {readr} which we'll be using again shortly. You should
also see an important package call {igraph} that we will rely on heavily
for our network analyses in this course.

If you are working in RStudio Desktop, or notice that the packages have
not been installed and/or loaded, run the following `install.packages()`
function code to install the {tidyverse} and {igraph} packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("igraph") 
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Use the `library()` function and the code chunk below and load the
following packages:

-   tidyverse
-   igraph
-   tidygraph
-   ggraph
-   skmir
-   janitor

```{r load_packages}
# YOUR CODE HERE

```

**RStudio Tip:** You can always check to see which packages have already
been installed and loaded into RStudio Cloud by looking at the the
Files, Plots, & Packages Pane in the lower right hand corner of RStudio
as shown in the following screenshot:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. WRANGLE

In general, data wrangling involves some combination of cleaning,
reshaping, transforming, and merging data [@wickham2016r]. The
importance of data wrangling is difficult to overstate, as it involves
the initial steps of going from the raw data to a dataset that can be
explored and modeled [@krumm2018].

For our data wrangling this week, we're keeping it simple since working
with network data is a bit of a departure from our working with
rectangular data frames. Our primary goals for Section 2 are learning
how to:

a.  **Import Lists**. An obvious and also important first step, we need
    to "read" our data into R and learn about formatting for edge-lists
    and node attribute files.

b.  **Create a Graph Object**. Before performing network analyses, we'll
    need to convert our data frames into a graph object for working with
    relational data.

### 2a. Import Data

#### The Edge-List Format

To get started, we need to import, or "read", our data into R. The
function used to import your data will depend on the file format of the
data you are trying to import, but R is pretty adept at working with
many files types.

Take a look in the `/data` folder in your Files pane. You should see the
following .csv files:

-   `dlt1-edges.csv`

-   `dlt1-nodes.csv`

The first file `dlt1-edges.csv` is an edge-list that contains
information about each tie, or relation between two actors in a network.
In this context, a "tie" is a reply by one participant in the discussion
forum to the post of another participant -- or in some cases to their
own post! These ties between a single actor are called "self-loops" and
as we'll see later, {tidygraph} has a special function to remove these
self loops from a sociogram, or network visualization.

The edge-list format is slightly different than other formats you have
likely worked with before in that the values in the first two columns
each row represent a dyad, or tie between two nodes in a network. An
edge-list can also contain other information regarding the strength,
duration, or frequency of the relationship, sometime called "weight", in
addition to other "edge attributes."

In addition to our `Sender` and `Reciever` dyad pairs, our DLT 1 dataset
contains the following edge attributes:

-   `Sender` = Unique identifier of author of comment

-   `Receiver` = Unique identifier of identified recipient of comment

-   `Timestamp` = Time post or reply was posted

-   `Parent` = Primary category or topic of thread

-   `Category` = Subcategory or subtopic of thread

-   `Thread_id` = Unique identifier of a thread

-   `Comment_id` = Unique identifier of a comment\\

Let's use the `read_csv()` function from the {readr} and {janitor}
packages introduced in previous units to read in our edge-list and clean
up the variables names:

```{r read_edges}
dlt1_ties <- read_csv("data/dlt1-edges.csv", 
                      col_types = cols(Sender = col_character(), 
                                       Receiver = col_character(), 
                                       `Category Text` = col_skip(), 
                                       `Comment ID` = col_character(), 
                                       `Discussion ID` = col_character())) |>
  clean_names()

dlt1_ties
```

Note the addition of the `col_types =` argument for changing the column
types to character strings since the numbers for those particular
columns indicate actors (`Sender` and `Reciever`) and attributes
(`Comment_ID` and `Discussion_Id`). We also skipped the `Category Text`
since this was left blank for deidentification purposes.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Consider the example pictured below of a discussion thread from the
Planning for the Digital Learning Transition in K-12 Schools (DLT 1)
where our data orginated. This thread was initiated by participant I, so
the comments by J and N are considered to be directed at I. The comment
of B, however, is a direct response to the comment by N as signaled by
the use of the quote-feature as well as the explicit mentioning of N's
name within B's comment.

![](img/discussion-thread.png)

Now answer the following questions as they relate to the DLT 1 edge-list
we just read into R.

1.  Which actors in this thread are the `Sender` and the `Reciever`?
    Which actor is both?

    -   YOUR RESPONSE HERE

2.  How many dyads are in this thread? Which pairs of actors are dyads?

    -   YOUR RESPONSE HERE

**Sidebar:** Unfortunately, these types of nuances in discussion forum
data as illustrated by this simple example are rarely captured through
automated approaches to constructing networks. Fortunately, the dataset
you are working with was carefully reviewed to try and capture more
accurately the intended recipients of each reply.

#### Node Attributes

The second file we'll be using contains all the nodes or actors (i.e.,
participants who posted to the discussion forum) as well as some of
their attributes such as gender and years of experience in education.

Carolan (2013) notes that most social network analyses include variables
that describe attributes of actors, ones that are either categorical
(e.g., sex, race, etc.) or continuous in nature (e.g., test scores,
number of times absent, etc.). These attributes that can be incorporated
into a network graph or model, making it more informative and can aid in
testing or generating hypotheses.

These attribute variables are typically included in a rectangular array,
or dataframe, that mimics the actor-by-attribute that is the dominant
convention in social science, i.e. rows represent cases, columns
represent variables, and cells consist of values on those variables.

As an aside, Carolan also refers to this historical preference by
researchers for "actor-by-attribute" data, in the absence of relational
data in which the actor has been removed their social context, as the
"sociological meatgrinder" in action. Specifically, this historical
approach assumes that the actor does not interact with anyone else in
the study and that outcomes are solely dependent of the characteristics
of the individual.

#### 👉 Your Turn **⤵**

Use the code chunk below to import the `dlt1-nodes.csv` attribute file
and be sure to set the following variables as character data types:
`UID`, `Facilitator`, `expert`, `connect`.

```{r read_nodes}
# YOUR CODE HERE

```

Now use the code chunk below to inspect the data you imported and
complete the matching exercise that follows:

```{r}
#YOUR CODE HERE

```

Match up the attributes included in the node file with the following
codebook descriptors. The first one has been done as an example.

-   `Facilitator` = Identification of course facilitator (1 =
    instructor)
-   Dummy variable for whether participants listed networking and
    collaboration with others as one of their course goals on the
    registration form
-   Identifier of "expert panelists" invited to course to share
    experience through recorded Q&A
-   Identification of course facilitator (1 **=** instructor)
-   Professional role (eg, teacher, librarian, administrator)
-   Years of experience as an educator
-   Works with elementary, middle, and/or high school students
-   Initial assignment of discussion group

**RStudio Tip:** Importing data and dealing with data types can be a bit
tricky, especially for beginners. Fortunately, RStudio has an "Import
Dataset" feature in the Environment Pane that can help you use the
{readr} package and associated functions to greatly facilitate this
process.

![](img/import-data.png)

### 2b. Create Network Object

As demonstrated in our previous case study, we first need to convert the
data frames that we imported into an network object before we can begin
using many of the functions from our network packages for summarizing
and visualizing our DLT 1 network.

#### Convert to Graph Object

To do that, we will use the `tbl_graph()` function from the {tidygraph}
package. Note that I included the `eval=FALSE` argument in the code
block below to prevent this code from running when we knit our final
document. Otherwise it will produce an error since we can't include help
documentation in our knitted HTML file.

Run the following code to take a look at the help documentation for this
function:

```{r function_help, eval=FALSE}
?tbl_graph
```

You probably saw that this particular function takes the following three
arguments, two of which are data frames:

-   **`edges =`** A `data.frame` containing information about the edges
    in the graph. The terminal nodes of each edge must either be encoded
    in a `to` and `from` column, or be in the two first columns.

-   **`nodes =`** a node list that starts with a column of node IDs. Any
    following columns are interpreted as node attributes.

-   **`node_key =`** The name of the column in `nodes` that character
    represented `to` and `from` columns should be matched against.

-   **`directed =`** determines whether or not to create a directed
    graph.

Run the following code to specify our `ties` data frame as the edges of
our network, our `actors` data frame for the vertices of our network and
their attributes, and indicate that this is indeed a directed network.

```{r create_network}
dlt1_network <- tbl_graph(edges = dlt1_ties,
                          nodes = dlt1_actors,
                          node_key = "uid",
                          directed = TRUE)
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Take a look at the output for our `dlt1_network` and answer the
questions that follow:

```{r inspect_network}
#YOUR CODE HERE

```

1.  How does the number of node and edges in our DLT 1 network compare
    to the totals reported for the DLT 2, the second iteration of this
    MOOC-Ed, reported on in our [guiding
    study](https://github.com/sbkellogg/eci-589/blob/main/unit-1/lit/sna_mooc_irrodl_bjet_articles.pdf)?

2.  Do the number of nodes and edges are in our network match the number
    of observations in our node and edge list .csv files? **Hint:**

3.  Our output notes that our network is a directed multigraph,
    indicating that some dyads may have multiple edges. Why might that
    be?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. EXPLORE

As noted in the previous units, exploratory data analysis involves the
processes of describing your network through mathematical measures
and/or data visualization. In Section 3, we learn some new functions for
identifying groups and subgroups and creating node-level measures to
identify central actors in our network. Specifically, in this section
we'll focus on:

a.  **Group Analysis**. We take a look at both a top-down and bottom-up
    approach to identifying groups within a network by examining the
    weak and strong components in our network as well as existing
    cliques.

b.  **Egocentric Analysis**. We also examine the size of an ego's "local
    neighborhood" as well as key centrality measures for each node such
    as degree, closeness, and betweenness.

### 3a. Analyze Groups: Components & Cliques

#### Components

As noted in Social Network Analysis and Education [@carolan2014], one of
the most basic ways in which network researchers first characterize a
network's substructure is to identify its components.

> A **component** is a connected subgraph in which there is a path
> between all pairs of nodes.

Recall from our output above that our "multigraph" had 4 components.
Let's take a quick look at our network and see if we can spot the 4
components:

```{r autograph}
autograph(dlt1_network)
```

As you can see, three of our components are isolates in our network,
meaning they have no connections, or forum replies to or from, anyone
else in the network. That is, they posted to a discussion forum and
never received a reply, or replied to the posts of others.

Directed graphs, such as the DLT 1 network, have two different kinds of
components: weak and strong. A weak component, like ours above, ignores
the direction of a tie; strong components do not. Rather,

> **Strong components** consist of nodes that are connected to one
> another via both directions along the path that connects them.

This concept of a component is simple and very useful, especially when
analyzing a large network with many components. Often, researchers
extract each component and analyze it as a separate network. We won't be
doing that here, but it would be very reasonable to remove the isolates
from our network prior to further analysis.

The {igraph} package has a simple function for identifying the number of
components in a network, the size of each component, and which actors
belong to each. Let's first take a quick look at the summaries for
"weak" components in our network:

```{r components_weak}
components(dlt1_network, mode = c("weak"))
```

While not incredibly intuitive to interpret, the output indicates that
there are 4 components as we discovered above, 1 component has 442
members and three (our isolates) have only 1 member.

One issue with this output that the {tidygraph} package is great at
solving is identifying and saving as a new variable who belongs to which
component. We can sort of see from above that the first 400+ actors in
our network belong to component 1, while the three isolates towards the
end belong to components 2, 3, and 4 respectively; and the last two
nodes in our network also belong to component 1.

How do you think you might find the "strong" components in our network
using the `component()` function? Use the following code chunk to test
out your theory:

```{r components_strong}
# YOUR CODE HERE

components(dlt1_network, mode = c("strong"))
```

Wow! If your code was correct, you'll see that we have a whopping 209
distinct components!

As demonstrated in the previous case study, the {tidygraph} package has
a very useful `activate()` function for working with our nodes and edges
as if they were standard "tibbles," or [tidy
data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)
tables.

Let's use the `activate()` function to single out the node list in our
network and use the familiar `mutate()` and
[`group_components()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/group_graph.html)
functions to create a new `strong_component` variable that indicates and
saves the strong components to which each node belongs:

```{r group_components}
dlt1_network <- dlt1_network |>
  activate(nodes) |>
  mutate(strong_component = group_components(type = "strong"))
```

Let's take a look at the nodes in our new `dlt1_network`, which should
now contain our new variable. To do so, we'll use another handy function
from the {tidygraph} package, `as_tibble()`, that will temporarily
convert our node list to a standard table that will allow us to view
every row in our node list:

```{r as_tibble}
as_tibble(dlt1_network)
```

We could even extend this if we liked to create some standard table
summaries using the `summarise()` function. Run the code below to create
a count of the number of nodes in each strong component:

```{r count_components}
dlt1_network |>
  as_tibble() |>
  group_by(strong_component) |>
  summarise(count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count))
```

Similar to our graph of weak components, we see this network has a
strong component with many members (n=237), and the remaining components
are all isolated nodes.

If we wanted to illustrate this with a sociogram, we could create a new
edge variable using the same `activate()` and `mutate()` functions and
`filter()` our edges so our graph only contains reciprocated ties, like
so:

```{r filter_reciprocated}
dlt1_network |>
  activate(edges) |>
  mutate( reciprocated = edge_is_mutual()) |> 
  filter(reciprocated == TRUE) |>
  autograph()
```

Or we could filter out all isolates in our strong component network
entirely using the same `activate()` and `filter()` functions:

```{r filter_component}
dlt1_network |>
  activate(nodes) |>
  filter(strong_component == 1) |>
  autograph()
```

Obviously, this graph would need some polishing before sharing with
others, but you get the point. The `activate()` function from the
{tidygraph} package is a powerful tool that let's you leverage the
entire suite of {tidyverse} packages to analyze nodes and edges in a
network! We'll be using the activate function again in section [3b.
Egocentric Analysis: Size &
Centrality](#b.-egocentric-analysis-size-centrality) to calculate
node-level measures.

#### Cliques

Whereas top-down approaches to group analysis focus on the complete
network and considers parts of it that distinct from the rest of the
network, the bottom-up approach focuses is built up from simple dyads
and triads that extend into dense clusters that give the network its
"clumpiness." Similar to complete network measures, there are several
important properties for which precise definitions and algorithms have
been developed, including cliques, clans, plexes, and cores
[@carolan2014].

Examining cliques is one bottom-up approach that reveals how groups are
distributed in the network and which actors belong to which groups.

> A **clique** is a maximally connected subgraph of nodes (> 2) in which
> all nodes are connected to each other.

Similar to our component analysis, the {igraph} function has a simple
`clique_num()` function for identifying number of completely connected
subgroups in a network:

```{r clique_number}
clique_num(dlt1_network)
```

As you probably saw above, the `clique_num()` function does not take
into account directionality of our ties. It looks like we have 8 dense
clusters of nodes that all have ties to one another.

The {igraph} function also has a simple `cliques()` function for
identifying members who belong to the same group. In addition to
specifying the network you want to examine, this function also allows
you to set the minimum and maximum number of members to included in a
clique.

Let's see if there are any cliques that contain a minimum of 8 nodes?

```{r cliques}
cliques(dlt1_network, min = 8, max = NULL)
```

Unfortunately, the {tidygraph} package does not have a clustering
function for cliques. It does, however, include a range popular
clustering functions provided that use range of functions that group
nodes and edges based on "community structure." Some of these [community
detection
algorithms](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/group_graph.html)
are designed for directed graphs (e.g. our strong component analysis
above), while others are for undirected graphs.

One function similar to our clique analysis above is the
`group_edge_betweenness()` function, which group densely connected nodes
together. The betweenness centrality measures is something we will look
at more closely in the next section.

Because this function can only be used with undirected networks, we will
need to pipe `|>` our `dlt_network` through the following functions in
sequence:

1.  **`morph()`** with the `to_undirected` argument will temporarily
    change our directed network to an undirected network, or
    "symmetrize" our network as discussed in Carolan @carolan2014;
2.  **`activate()`** will select just our `nodes` list;
3.  **`mutate()`** will created a new `subgroup` variable using the
    `group_edgebetweenness()` function;
4.  **`unmorph()`** will change our undirected network back to a
    directed network.

Run the following code to group our nodes based on their edge
betweenness and print our updated `dlt1_network` object and take a quick
look. Because this is a bit computationally intensive, it make take a
minute or so to run.

```{r edge_betweenness}
dlt1_network <- dlt1_network |>
  morph(to_undirected) |>
  activate(nodes) |>
  mutate(sub_group = group_edge_betweenness()) |>
  unmorph()

dlt1_network |>
  as_tibble()
```

As you scroll through the nodes tibble produced, you should now see at
the far end a new `subgroup` variable that includes an ID number
indicating to which densely connected cluster each node belongs.

Finally, let get a count of Run the following code to group our nodes
and print our new `cccss_network_groups` object and take a quick look:

```{r group_count}
dlt1_network |>
  activate(nodes) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  group_by(sub_group) |>
  summarise(count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count))
```

This out is very telling and suggestive that our network may have a
typical **core-periphery structure**: a group of well-connected actors
at the center of the network with a set of actors residing on the
periphery whose only connections are typically to those actors
affiliated with this core group. At the core of our network might reside
these actors in subgroup 1, with the remaining actors residing on the
periphery.

Note, that if we had wanted to permanently convert our network to an
undirected network, we could use the `to_undirected` argument as a
stand-alone function.

```{r to_undirected}
dlt1_undirected <-  to_undirected(dlt1_network)

dlt1_undirected
```

The {tidygraph} package has a wide range of [functions to generate
alternate representations of
graphs](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/morphers.html).
They can be used as stand alone functions to permanently alter your
network, or as an argument with the `morph()` function to temporarily
change your network depending on the analyses you need to perform.

### 3b. Egocentric Analysis: Size & Centrality {#b.-egocentric-analysis-size-centrality}

In this section, we shift out analytical lens from groups to egos and
the pattern of relations in which each individual is embedded. Implicit
in egocentric analysis, and also very intuitive to understand, is that:

> An individual's (**ego**) connections with others (**alters**)
> provides access to some instrumental (e.g., advice) or expressive
> (e.g., support) resource that may, in turn, be beneficial.

As summarized by Carolan @carolan2014, the structure and content of
these relations between an ego and a set of alters is the focus of
egocentric network analysis. Since our research question aims to
identify "key actors" in our network, we will look at two
characteristics of an ego's connections that are indicative their
importance: size and centrality.

#### Size

Recall from our previous case study focused on complete network
analysis, one simple and often ignored structural property of a social
network is its size. This also applies to egocentric analysis.

> **Size** is simply the number of alters that are directly connected to
> ego.

This characteristic is also sometimes referred to as an ego's **local
neighborhood**, and as Carolan points out, size matters, because it
indicates the amount of potential resources available in one's network.
For example, a student with a small friendship network may be at a
disadvantage when it comes seeking support on schoolwork or advice on
course or college enrollment.

We can use the same {tidygraph} process that we used for identifying
groups and individual membership to calculate the size for each node.
Specifically, we will need to `activate()` the `nodes` in our network
and create a new variable which we'll call `size` that is calculated
using the `local_size()` function.

And since it's much easier to inspect our data as a tibble than using
the graph output, we'll also convert our node to a table and `arrange()`
in descending order by `size` to make it easier to see the range in
values of our network:

```{r local_size}
dlt1_network <- dlt1_network |>
  activate(nodes) |>
  mutate(size = local_size())

dlt1_network |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  arrange(desc(size)) |> 
  select(uid, facilitator, size)
```

Not surprisingly, the egos with the most alters are the course
facilitators who played a very active role in this course and therefore
have an outsize influence on the structure of this network.

**Note:** In the code immediately above or earlier in this case study,
it's important to take note when we have permanently altered our
`dlt1_network` object and when we have only made temporary changes to
our network. For example, when creating a new variable for local
neighborhood size, we assigned the changes made to `dlt1_network` to an
object of the same name using the `<-` assignment operator. This
effectively overwrites the old object with the new object because was
wanted to save the new variable created. However, when converting
network to a tibble consisting of nodes and their `facilitor` and `size`
attributes, we did not assign to `dlt1_network` because we did not want
to permanently change to our network object to a tibble.

#### Centrality

As we learned in our previous case study and readings, a key structural
property of networks is the concept of centralization. A network that is
highly centralized is one in which relations are focused on a small
number of actors or even a single actor in a network, whereas ties in a
decentralized network are diffuse and spread over a number of actors. As
we saw above, the facilitators in our network play an outsize role in
the MOOC-Ed discussions!

**Degree**

One of the most common descriptives reported in network studies and a
primary measure of centralization is degree.

> **Degree** is the number of ties to and from an ego. In a directed
> network, in-degree is the number of ties received, whereas out-degree
> is the number of ties sent.

The {tidygraph} package has an aptly named function
`centrality_degree()` for calculating degree, in-degree, and out-degree
for all actors in a network.

Run the following create two new variables for our nodes: `in_dgree` and
`out_degree`. We'll set the `mode =` argument in `centrality_degree()`
function to `"in"` and `"out"` respectively.

```{r centrality_degree}
dlt1_network <- dlt1_network |>
  activate(nodes) |>
  mutate(in_degree = centrality_degree(mode = "in"),
         out_degree = centrality_degree(mode = "out"))
  
dlt1_network |> 
  as_tibble()
```

**A Quick Note about Multigraphs and Tie Strength**

You may have noticed in this network that indegree exceeds the total
number of nodes in our network are are wondering how that is possible.
Recall that our network is currently treated at a "multigraph,"
indicating that some dyads have multiple edges. Therefore, some edges
between dyads are counted more than once.

Alternatively, we could
"[simplify](https://igraph.org/r/doc/simplify.html)" our network by
collapsing multiple edges between the same actors and assigning a value
to edges between actors indicating tie strength. In this case it would
be a measure of frequency of replies between actors. However, in the
process of simplifying our network, we would lose important contextual
information about the context of each tie, such as the when (timestamp)
and where (forum) each tie was created.

Let's dust off our
[`ggplot()`](https://ggplot2-book.org/getting-started.html#basic-use)
skills and take a look at the distribution of `out_degree`, or the
number of replies to other posts, by using in `geom_histogram()`
function for creating histograms.

```{r geom_histogram}
dlt1_network |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = out_degree))
```

We can see that most egos in the network sent very few replies to alters
in the course, while a handful of actors in this network have sent 30 or
more replies.

**Compositional and Variance Measures**

Carolan @carolan2014 notes that there are two types of measures that can
emerge from egocentric data: compositional and variance. Compositional
measures are those created by counting or taking the average of
egocentric network variables. Variance measures, on the other hand, are
simply those that are derived by calculating the variance or standard
deviation of the egocentric network variables.

While we could calculate invdividually the mean and variance for each
egocentric measure created above using the `summarise()` function
demonstrated earlier, R has a package and function to save us the
effort.

To quickly calculate summary statistics for our nodes, including
compositional and variance measures for our egocentric measures, we can
use the `skim()` function from the {skimr} package to take a quick look
at the variables in our node list:

```{r skimr}
dlt1_network |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  skim()
```

We can see, for example, that egos in our network are connected with on
average 8.75 alters with a standards deviation of 17.5. Notice also that
our mean for in-degree and out-degree are identical. This will always be
the case since for every tie that goes "in" there is always one going
"out."

Finally, the {skimr} package like our {tidgraph} package plays nicely
with other {tidyverse} packages for data wrangling and analysis. For
example, let's select only MOOC-Ed participants who are located in the
United States and calculate compositional and variance measures for
`size` by educator's role:

```{r size_role}
dlt1_network |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  filter(country == "US") |>
  group_by(role1) |>
  select(size) |>
  skim()
```

As illustrated by the output above, we can see that "otheredprof" (i.e.,
other educational professionals including our facilitators) were
connected with the most individuals on average (18.9), while educators
in "Operations" connected with the fewest individuals on average (3).

**Closeness & Betweenness**

Two other centrality measures for identifying key actors in a network
are closeness and betweenness. Whereas degree centrality is a local
measure and can be calculated without needing information about the
overall pattern of relations among ego and alters, closeness and
betweenness address this shortcoming by taking into account indirect
ties among all the alters in an ego's network.

**Closeness** centrality captures the average distance an actor is from
all other actors in the network and is a function of an actor's geodesic
distance to others, which equals the length of shortest path connecting
a pair of actors. It's an intuitively appealing measure in that being
"close" to others may provide an advantage by giving you early access to
new information or by indicating how quickly an actor can exchange
something with others (Knoke & Yang, 2008).

**Betweenness** centrality measures the degree to which other actors lie
on the shortest geodesic path between pairs of actors in the network.
Betweenness may be indicative of how actors control or mediate the
relations between pairs of actors that are not directly connected.
Therefore, this measure is an important indicator of control over
information exchange or resource flows within a network (Knoke & Yang,
2008). The more any given actor is located on the path between numerous
dyads, the higher that actor's potential to control network
interactions. This concept and its associated measure is very appealing,
as it captures the degree to which an actor occupies a strategically
important position.

## 4. MODEL

As highlighted in [Chapter 3 of Data Science in Education Using
R](https://datascienceineducation.com/c03.html), the **Model** step of
the data science process entails "using statistical models, from simple
to complex, to understand trends and patterns in the data." The authors
note that while descriptive statistics and data visualization during
the **Explore** step can help us to identify patterns and relationships
in our data, statistical models can be used to help us determine if
relationships, patterns and trends are actually meaningful.

We will not explore the use of models for SNA until Unit 3, but recall
from [A Social Network Perspective in MOOC-Eds] was guided by the
following questions:

1.  What are the patterns of peer interaction and the structure of peer
    networks that emerge over the course of a MOOC-Ed?

2.  To what extent do participant and network attributes (e.g.,
    homophily, reciprocity, transitivity) account for the structure of
    these networks?

3.  To what extent do these networks result in the co-construction of
    new knowledge?

To address Question 1, actors in the network were categorized into
distinct mutually exclusive groups using the core-periphery and regular
equivalence functions of UCINET. The former used the CORR algorithm to
divide the network into actors that are part of a densely connected
subgroup, or "core", from those that are part of the sparsely connected
periphery. Regular equivalence employs the REGE blockmodeling algorithm
to partition, or group, actors in the network based on the similarity of
their ties to others with similar ties. In essence, blockmodeling
provides a systematic way for categorizing educators based on the ways
in which they interacted with peers.

As we saw upon just a basic visual inspection of our network during the
Explore section, there was a small core of highly connected participants
surrounded by those on the "periphery," or edge, of the network with
very few connections. In the DLT 2 course, those on the periphery made
up roughly 90% of network! The study also found relatively high levels
of reciprocation, but also found that roughly a quarter of participants
were characterized as "brodcasters" -- educators who initiated a
discussion thread, but neither reciprocated with those who replied, nor
posted to threads initiated by others.

To address Question 2, this study use the exponential family of random
graph models (ERGM; also known as p\* models), which provide a
statistical approach to network modeling that addresses the complex
dependencies within networks. ERGMs predict network ties and determine
the statistical likelihood of a given network structure, based on an
assumed dependency structure, the attributes of the individuals (e.g.,
gender, popularity, location, previous ties) and prior states of the
network.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Recall that network analyses to identify groups, positions, and central
actors are a means to an end rather than an end in itself
[@carolan2014]. One primary goal of gathering data about a network's
groups, positions, and central actors -- a goal which we'll explore more
deeply in later units -- is test whether there is a relationship between
these measures and educational outcomes of interest. That was ultimately
the aim of the research article guiding this study, but sadly got
neglected.

Thinking about the node and group level analyses we've conducted so far,
and what you know about this educational context so far, write a
research question or hypothesis you would like to test that would
examine whether there is a relationship between these group or
node-level measures and educational outcomes appropriate for this
MOOC-Ed.
