## 1. PREPARE

Our first SNA case study is guided by the work of Matthew Pittinsky and Brian V. Carolan (2008), which employed a social network perspective to examine teachers' perceptions of student friendships agreed with their own. Sadly, this excellent study did not include any visual depictions comparing student and teacher perceived friendship networks, but we are going to fix that!

Our primary aim for this case study is to gain some hands-on experience with essential R packages and functions for SNA. We learn how to preparing network data for analysis and creating a simple network sociogram to help describe visually what our network "looks like." Specifically, this case study will cover the following topics pertaining to each data-intensive workflow process [@krumm2018]:

1.  **Prepare**: Prior to analysis, we'll look at the context from which our data came, formulate some research questions, and get introduced the {tidygraph} and {ggraph} packages for analyzing and visualizing relational data.

2.  **Wrangle**: In the wrangling section of our case study, we will learn some basic techniques for manipulating, cleaning, transforming, and merging network data.

3.  **Explore**: With our network data tidied, we learn to calculate some key network measures and to illustrate some of these stats through network visualization.

4.  **Model**: We conclude our analysis by introducing community detection algorithms for identifying groups and revisiting sentiment about the common core.

5.  **Communicate**: We develop a polished sociogram to highlight key findings.

### 1a. Review the Research

Pittinsky, M., & Carolan, B. V. (2008). Behavioral versus cognitive classroom friendship networks. *Social Psychology of Education*, *11*(2), 133-147.

#### Abstract

Researchers of social networks commonly distinguish between "behavioral" and "cognitive" social structure. In a school context, for example, a teacher's perceptions of student friendship ties, not necessarily actual friendship relations, may influence teacher behavior. Revisiting early work in the field of sociometry, this study assesses the level of agreement between teacher perceptions and student reports of within-classroom friendship ties. Using data from one middle school teacher and four classes of students, the study explores new ground by assessing agreement over time and across classroom social contexts, with the teacher-perceiver held constant. While the teacher's perceptions and students' reports were statistically similar, 11--29% of possible ties did not match. In particular, students reported significantly more reciprocated friendship ties than the teacher perceived. Interestingly, the observed level of agreement varied across classes and generally increased over time. This study further demonstrates that significant error can be introduced by conflating teacher perceptions and student reports. Findings reinforce the importance of treating behavioral and cognitive classroom friendship networks as distinct, and analyzing social structure data that are carefully aligned with the social process hypothesized.

#### Research Questions

The central question guiding this investigation was:

> Do student reports agree with teacher perceptions when it comes to classroom friendship ties and with what consequences for commonly used social network measures?

We will be using this question to guide our own analysis of the classroom friendships reported by teachers. Specifically, we will use the first part of this question to guide our analysis and develop two sociograms to help visually compare similarities and differences between teacher and student reported classroom friendships.

#### Data Collection

To measure the level of agreement between student and teacher reports of classroom student friendships, sociometric data were collected from each student in all four classes and the teacher provided similar reports on all students. To collect student reports of friendships, students were given a class roster and asked to describe their relationship with each student in the class. Choices included best friend, friend, know-like, know, know-dislike, strongly dislike, and do not know. In the terminology of network analysis, these sociometric data are "valued" (degrees of friendship, not just yes or no) and "directed" (friendship nominations were not presumed to be reciprocal). Data were collected in the autumn and spring. All "best friend" and "friend" choices are coded as '1' (friend), while all other choices are coded as '0' (not friend). The teacher's reports of students' friendships were generated in a similar manner.

#### Analyses

To assess agreement between perceived friendship by the teacher and students, QAP (quadratic assignment procedure) correlations for each class's two matrices (teacher and student generated) were analyzed in the autumn and spring. A QAP correlation is used to calculate the degree of association between two sets of relations; it tests whether the probability of dyad overlap in the teacher matrix is correlated with the probability of dyad overlap in the student matrix. It does so by running a large number of simulations. These simulations generate random matrices with sizes and value distributions based on the original two matrices being tested. It then computes an average level of correlation between the matrices that would be expected at random. Similarly, it calculates the probability that the observed degree of correlation between two matrices would be as large or as small as that observed based on the range of correlations generated in the random permutations, with an associated significance statistic.

#### Key Findings

As reported by @pittinsky2008behavioral in their findings section:

> While the teacher's perceptions and students' reports were statistically similar, 11--29% of possible ties did not match. In particular, students reported significantly more reciprocated friendship ties than the teacher perceived.

### 1b. Load Packages

A Python package or library is a collection of modules that offer a set of functions, classes, and variables that enable developers and data analysts to perform many tasks without writing their code from scratch. These can include everything from performing mathematical operations to handling network communications, manipulating images, and more.

#### pandas 📦

![](img/pandas.svg){width="30%"}

One package that we'll be using extensively is {pandas}. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) [@mckinney-proc-scipy-2010] is a powerful and flexible open source data analysis and wrangling tool for Python that is used widely by the data science community.

Click the green arrow in the right corner of the "code chunk" that follows to load the {pandas} library introduced in LA Workflow labs.

```{python}

import pandas as pd

```

Next, we will introduce two new packages extend the tidyverse suite of packages and that we will use throughout SNA Learning Labs 1-4.

#### NetworkX 📦

![](img/networkx.png){width="20%"}

[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/) [@SciPyProceedings_11] is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It provides tools for the study of the structure and dynamics of social, biological, and infrastructure networks, including:

-   Data structures for graphs, digraphs, and multigraphs

-   Many standard graph algorithms

-   Network structure and analysis measures

-   Generators for classic graphs, random graphs, and synthetic networks

-   Nodes that can be "anything" (e.g., text, images, XML records)

-   Edges that can hold arbitrary data (e.g., weights, time-series)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Ability to work with large nonstandard data sets.

With NetworkX you can load and store networks in standard and nonstandard data formats, generate many types of random and classic networks, analyze network structure, build network models, design new network algorithms, draw networks, and much more.

## 2. WRANGLE

In general, data wrangling involves some combination of cleaning, reshaping, transforming, and merging data [@wickham2016r]. As highlighted in @estrellado2020e, wrangling network data can be even more challenging than other data sources since network data often includes variables about both individuals and their relationships.

For our data wrangling in module 1, we're keeping it relatively simple since working with relational data is a bit of a departure from working with rectangular data frames. Our primary goals for Lab 1 is learning how to:

a.  **Import Data from Excel**. In this section, we learn about the `read_xlsx()` function for importing network data stored in two common formats: matrices and nodelists.

b.  **Convert to Network Data Structure**. Before we can create our sociogram, we'll first need to convert our data frames into special data structure for storing graphs.

### 2a. Import Data

One of our primary goals for this case study to is create network graph called a sociogram that visually describes what a network "looks like" from the perspective of both students and their teacher. To do so, we'll need to import two Excel files originally obtained from the [Social Network Analysis and Education companion site](#0). Both files contain edges stored as a matrix and are included in the lab-1 data folder of your R Studio project. A description of each file from the companion website is copied below along with a link to the original file:

1.  [**99472_ds3.xlsx**](https://studysites.sagepub.com/carolan/study/materials/datasets/99472_ds3.xlsx) This adjacency matrix consists of **student-reported** friendship relations among 27 students in one class in the fall semester. These data are directed and unweighted; a friendship tie is present if the student reported that another was either a best friend or friend.

2.  [**99472_ds5.xlsx**](https://studysites.sagepub.com/carolan/study/materials/datasets/99472_ds5.xlsx) This adjacency matrix consists of the **teacher-reported** friendship relations among 27 students in one class in the fall semester. These data are directed and unweighted; a friendship tie is present if the teacher reported that students were either a best friend or friend.

Relational data (i.e., information about the relationships among individuals in a network) are sometimes stored as an [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix). Network data stored as a matrix includes a column and row for each actor in our network and each cell contains information about the **tie** between each pair of actors, often referred to as **edges**. In our case, each tie is **directed,** meaning that relationships between actors may not necessarily be reciprocated. For example, student 1 may report student 2 as a friend, but student 2 may or may not report student 1 as friend. If both student 2 and student 2 indicate each other as friends, then this tie, or edge, is considered **reciprocal** or **mutual**.

#### Import Student-Reported Friendships

Let's use the `read_excel()` function from the {pandas} package to import the `student-reported-friends.xlsx` file. In our function, we'll include an important "argument" called `header =` and set it to `None`. This tells Python that our file does not include column names and is important to include since our file is a simple matrix with no header or column names and by default this argument is set to true and would assign the first row which contains data about student friendships as names for each column.

Finally, we need to make sure we can reference the matrix we import and use it later in our analysis. To do so, will save it to our "Environment" by assigning it to a variable which we will call `student_friends`.

```{python}

student_friends = pd.read_excel("data/student-reported-friends.xlsx", header = None)

```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Before importing our teacher-reported friendship file, use the code chunk below to quickly inspect the `student_friends` data we just imported to see what we'll be working with.

```{python}
# YOUR CODE HERE

student_friends

```

You should now see a 27 x 27 data table that represents student-reported friendships stored as an adjacency matrix. As noted on pg. 140 of @pittinsky2008behavioral, students were given a class roster and asked to describe their relationship with each student using the following choices: best friend, friend, know-like, know, know-dislike, strongly dislike, and do not know. In the terminology of network analysis, these sociometric data are
**valued** (degrees of friendship, not just yes or no).

For the purpose of the their study, and for this case study as well, all “best friend” and “friend” choices are coded as ‘1’ (friend), while all other choices are coded as ‘0’ (not friend). This process of taking a valued relationship or tie (i.e., degrees of friendship, not just yes or no) and simplifying into a binary yes/no relationship is referred to as **dichotomization** and we'll explore the benefits and drawbacks of this process in Module 4.

In addition to ties being valued or binary, they can also be undirected or directed. For example, in an **undirected** network**,** a friendship either exists between two actors or it does not. In a **directed** network, one actor or **ego** may indicate a relationship (e.g., friend or best friend), but the other actor or **alter** may indicate there is no friendship. If the relationship is present between both actors, however, the tie or edge is considered **reciprocated**.

#### ❓Question

Do the data we just imported indicate that these friendship ties are directed or undirected? How can you tell? Provide a brief response in the space below.

1.  YOUR RESPONSE HERE

#### Import Student Attributes

Before importing our teacher-reported student friendships, we have another important file to import. As noted by @carolan2014 , most social network analyses include variables that describe the attributes of actors in a network. These attribute variables can be either categorical (e.g., sex, race, etc.) or continuous in nature (e.g., test scores, number of times absent, etc.).

Actor attributes are stored a rectangular array, or data frame, in which rows represent a social entity (e.g., students, staff, schools, etc.), columns represent variables, and cells consist of values on those variables. This file containing a list of actors, or nodes, along with their attributes is sometimes referred to as a **node list**.

Let's go ahead and read our node list into R and store as a new object called `student_attributes`:

```{r student-attributes}

student_attributes <- read_excel("data/student-attributes.xlsx")

student_attributes
```

Note that when we imported this time, we left out the `col_names = FALSE` argument. As mentioned earlier, by default this argument is set to TRUE and assumes the first row of your data frame will contain names of the variables. Since this was indeed the case, we didn't need to include this argument. We could, however, have included this argument and set it to `TRUE` and our resulting output would still be the same.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Complete the code chunk below to import the `teacher-reported-friends.xlsx` file, add row and column names, and inspect your `teacher_friends` object.

```{r import-teacher}
# YOUR CODE HERE
teacher_friends <- read_excel("data/teacher-reported-friends.xlsx", 
                              col_names = FALSE)
rownames(teacher_friends) <- 1:27

colnames(teacher_friends) <- 1:27

teacher_friends
```

**RStudio Tip:** If you happen to run into issues with data import, RStudio has a handy "Import Dataset" feature for a point and click approach to adding data to your environment.

![](img/import.png)

If you want to give this a try, be sure to pay attention to the default settings and the name it will give your data frame when imported. Also be sure to include the R code it generates in your R script or markdown file.

### 2b. Make a Tidy Graph

Before we can begin exploring our data through through network visualization, we must first restructure our "tibble" into a formal matrix object recognized by r, and then convert our matrix to a network class R object required by the {tidygraph} and {ggraph} packages.

#### **Convert to Graph Object**

Our final step before we're able to begin exploring our data is to convert our matrix to a network object recognized by the {tidygraph} and {ggraph} packages.

The [`as_tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) general function can easily convert relational data from all common network data formats such as matrices, `network`, `phylo`, `dendrogram`, `data.tree`, `graph`, etc. 

Let's run the following code to convert our matrix to directed network graph and save as a new object called `student_network`. We'll also include the argument `directed = TRUE` in our `as_tbl_graph()` function to indicate that our network is directed.

```{r convert-network}
student_network <- as_tbl_graph(student_friends, 
                                directed = TRUE)
```

Now let's take a quick look at our new `student_network` object:

```{r student-network}
student_network
```

As you can see, our `student_network` object provides a range of information about out network including network size, type, number of components, and a preview of the node and edge lists that it created. The node and edge lists are treated just like a typical data frame and can now be used with other tidyverse packages and functions to create new actor-level network variables like degree, reciprocity, and centrality measures.

#### What is an edge list?

The node list is a pretty typical format for social science research, we've just given it a different name. But what exactly is an edge list?

> An **edgelist** is way to store relational data, or network ties, and commonly used in network analysis. Specifically, the values in the first two columns of each row represent a dyad, or tie between two nodes in a network.

This format is likely very different than other formats you have worked with before. An edge-list can also contain other information regarding the strength, duration, or frequency of the relationship, sometime called **weight**, in addition to other "edge attributes."

In directed networks like ours, the first column indicates that student 1 reported students 2, 4, and 5 are friends. Since our network is unweighted, the 1 for "weight" just indicates that a friendship was present. Our data folder also contains a valued adjacency matrix which indicates the "strength" of the relationship or friendship, but we'll stick with the simpler of the two matrices for now.

Let's take a closer look at those edges. The {tidygraph} package has a useful `activate()` function that we will be using extensively throughout the SNA learning labs. This function allows us to work with the nodes and edges in our network object as if they were typical data frames and apply to them the entire suite of {tidyverse} functions for wrangling and summarizing data.

For now, let's just use the `activate()` function to single out the edgelist in our network object, use the `as_tibble()` function to temporarily convert it to a data frame, and use the `<-` assignment operator to permanently save it in our environment as `student_edges`.

We'll also use a very powerful `|>` operator called a **pipe**. Pipes are a powerful tool for combining a sequence of functions or processes. The original pipe operator, `%>%`, comes from the {**magrittr**} package but all packages in the tidyverse load `%>%` for you automatically, so you don't usually load magrittr explicitly.

The pipe has become such a useful and much used operator in R that it is now baked into R using the new and simpler version of the pipe `|>` operator demonstrated in the following code chunk:

```{r}
student_edges <- student_network |>
  activate(edges) |>
  as_tibble()

student_edges
```

Great! Now we can see the full list of edges in our network ordered by student ids.

More importantly, however, is now that we have our edges stored in a standard format, we can combine our `student_edges` and `student_attributes` data frames into a single network object that contains the information from both!!

To do so, we'll use the more standard `tbl_graph()` function from the {tidygraph}. First, run the following code to take a look at the help documentation for this function:

```{r function_help, eval=FALSE}
?tbl_graph
```

You probably saw that this particular function takes the following three arguments, two of which are data frames:

-   **`edges =`** A `data.frame` containing information about the edges in the graph. The terminal nodes of each edge must either be encoded in a `to` and `from` column, or be in the two first columns.

-   **`nodes =`** a node list that starts with a column of node IDs. Any following columns are interpreted as node attributes.

-   **`node_key =`** The name of the column in `nodes` that character represented `to` and `from` columns should be matched against.

-   **`directed =`** determines whether or not to create a directed graph.

Now let's run the following code to specify our `ties` data frame as the edges of our network, our `actors` data frame for the vertices of our network and their attributes, and indicate that this is indeed a directed network.

```{r create-edgelist}
student_network <- tbl_graph(edges = student_edges, # specifies edges
                             nodes = student_attributes, # specifies nodes
                             directed = TRUE) # specifies directionality

student_network
```

Much better!! Now we can see that in addition to the edges in our network, our network object now contains information about students' gender and achievement levels in text and numerical format.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Complete the code chunk below to convert your `teacher_friends` object first to a matrix and then to a network object that contains information about both the teacher-reported student friendships and the attributes of students:

```{r teacher-network}
# YOUR CODE HERE

teacher_network <- as_tbl_graph(teacher_friends,
                                directed = TRUE)

teacher_edges <- teacher_network |>
  activate(edges) |>
  as_tibble()

teacher_network <- tbl_graph(edges = teacher_edges, 
                             nodes = student_attributes, 
                             directed = TRUE)

teacher_network
```

Now answer the questions that following questions:

1.  How many students are in our network?

    -   YOUR RESPONSE HERE

2.  Who reported more friendships, teachers or students? How do you know?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. EXPLORE

As noted in in our course readings, exploratory data analysis involves the processes of describing your data (such as by calculating the means and standard deviations of numeric variables, or counting the frequency of categorical variables) and, often, visualizing your data prior to modeling.

In Section 3 work focus on just visualization, and will use the {tidygraph} package to create a network sociogram to help visually describe our network and compare teacher and student reported friendships. Specifically, in this section we'll learn to make a:

a.  **Simple Sociogram**. We learn about the basic `plot()` and `auto_graph()` functions for creating a very quick network plot when just a quick visual inspection is needed.

b.  **Sophisticated Sociogram**. We then dive deeper in to the `ggraph()` function and learn to plot nodes and edges in our network and tweak key elements like the size, shape, and position of nodes and edges to better at communicating key findings.

One of the defining characteristics of the social network perspective is its use of graphic imagery to represent actors and their relations with one another. To emphasize this point, @carolan2014 reported that:

> The visualization of social networks has been a core practice since its foundation more than 100 years ago and remains a hallmark of contemporary social network analysis. 

Network visualization can be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from highlighting key actors to even serving as works of art.

This excellent figure from Katya Ognyanova's also excellent tutorial on [Static and Dynamic Network Visualization with R](https://kateto.net/network-visualization/) helps illustrate the variety of goals a good network visualization can accomplish:

![](img/viz-goals.jpeg){width="80%"}

### 3a. Simple Sociograms

These visual representations of the actors and their relations, i.e. the network, are called a **sociogram**. Actors who are most central to the network, such as those with higher node degrees, or those with more friends in our case study, are usually placed in the center of the sociogram and their ties are placed near them.

The `plot()` function from R's built in {graphics} package can be used to make a wide range of graphs, including sociograms, but as you'll see it's a bit lacking and is limited limited in the level of customization allowed.

In the code chunk below, use the `plot()` function with your `students_network` object to see what the basic plot function produces:

```{r plot-network}
plot(student_network)
```

Not super great. In fact, it's visualizations like these that give sociograms the unflattering nickname of "hair ball" plots!

If this had been a smaller network it might have been a little more useful but one important insight is that we have already identified an "isolate" in our network, i.e., student 19 who neither named others as a friend or was named by others as a friend.

Fortunately, the {ggraph} package includes a plethora of plotting parameters for graph [layouts](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Layouts.html), [edges](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Edges.html) and [nodes](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Nodes.html) to improve the visual design of network graphs.

Let's first take a quick look the `auto_graph()` function for making quick and simple sociograms similar to the R base plotting function above:

```{r auto-graph}
autograph(student_network)
```

A little better, but also lacking in many important ways. Like the `plot()` function, it does allow some small degree of customization, but is still rather limited and best use for very quick sociograms to get a quick feel for the data.

Run the following code chunk to see some additional arguments you can add to the `autograph()` function:

```{r student-sociogram}
autograph(student_network,
          node_label = id,
          node_colour = gender)
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Use the code chunk below to try out these simple sociogram functions on your `teacher_network` object you created above:

```{r teacher-sociogram}
# YOUR CODE HERE
plot(teacher_network)

autograph(teacher_network,
          node_size = local_size(),
          node_colour = local_size())
```

Not exactly great graphs, but they already provided some insight into our research questions. Specifically, we can see visually that teacher and student reported peer networks are very different!

### 3b. Sophisticated Sociograms

One thing to keep in mind when building a network viz with {ggraph}, is that just like it's `ggplot()` counterpart introduced in Foundation Labs, there is a minimal code template for producing a basic plot. Specifically, ggraph requires 3 main functions

-   [`ggraph()`](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Layouts.html) takes care of setting up the plot object along with creating the layout of the graph (default = "stress").

-   [`geom_node_*()`](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Layouts.html) functions and their associated arguments add and modify the nodes of the network plot.

-   [`geom_edge_*()`](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Edges.html) functions and their associated arguments add and modify the edgez of the network plot.

Let's first pass our `student_network` object to `ggraph()` and see what happens.

```{r ggraph}
ggraph(student_network)
```

Wow, that was unimpressive. But don't worry, just like the `ggplot()` function, `ggraph()` doesn't produce much on it's own. All that the `ggraph()` function does is set up the network object based on our `student_network`, and creates a layout for our sociogram, in this case using the default "stress" layout as indicated by the output.

#### Add Nodes

Very similar to how `ggplot()` uses the `+` operator to "layer" functions together to progressively build more sophisticated graphs, `ggraph()` uses the `+` operator progressively build a sociogram.

To add our nodes, we'll added the `geom_node_point()` function. Again, just like with {ggplot2}, the "geom" in the `geom_non_point()` functions stands for "Geometric elements", or geoms for short, and represents what you actually see in the plot.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Now "add" the `geom_node_point()` function to our code using the `+` operator:

```{r add-nodes}
ggraph(student_network) + 
  geom_node_point() 
```

Well, at least we have our nodes now!

#### Add Layout

One of the major advances in visualization since the first hand-drawn sociograms developed by Jacob Moreno (1934) to represent relations among children in school is the use of software and algorithms to automatically layout networks on a grid.

There are may different [layout methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing#Layout_methods), but we'll start with the Fruchterman-Reingold (FR) layout, which is one of the most widely used layout algorithms for network visualization. These types of force-directed algorithms generally work well with large networks and try to layout graphs in "an aesthetically-pleasing way" by making edges roughly equal in length and minimizing overlap.

Let's go ahead and include the layout argument, which in addition to including its own unique layouts, can incorporate layouts form {igraph} package like `fr` for the Fruchterman-Reingold (FR) layout:

```{r add-layout}
ggraph(student_network, layout = "fr") +
  geom_node_point()
```

That's not much better so let's stick with the "stress" layout for now. Feel free to try out some other [ggraph layout methods](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Layouts.html) if you like, however. There are also

#### Tweak Nodes

Also like {ggplot2}, geoms can include aesthetics, or aes for short, such as `alpha` for transparency, as well as `color`, `shape` and `size`.

Let's now add some "aesthetics" to our points by including the `aes()` function and arguments such as `size =` and `color =`. We'll use our `gender` variable for color and set the size of the node using `local_size()` function, which will base the size of each node on the number of friends each student nominated.

```{r add-color}
ggraph(student_network, layout = "stress") + 
geom_node_point(aes(color = gender,
                    size = local_size()))
```

We can easily see that the number of friends ranges from 5 to 20, with the exception of one "isolated" student we identified earlier who is not connected to any other students in the network, and therefore is smaller in size on the graph.

Let's fix that by adding another layer with some node text and labels. Since node labels are a geometric element, we can apply aesthetics to them as well, like color and size. Let's also include the `repel =` argument that when set to `TRUE` will avoid overlapping text.

```{r add-labels}
ggraph(student_network, layout = "stress") + 
  geom_node_point(aes(size = local_size(),
                      color = gender)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id,
                     size = local_size()),
                 repel = TRUE)
```

#### Add Edges

Now, let's literally connect the dots and add some [edges](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Edges.html) using the `geom_edge_link()` function.

```{r add-edges}
ggraph(student_network, layout = "stress") + 
  geom_node_point(aes(size = local_size(),
                      color = gender)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id),
                 repel=TRUE) +
  geom_edge_link()
```

Ack! Without some adjustment, the edges make it really difficult to see the nodes. Fortunately, you can also adjust the edges just like we did to the nodes above: Let's now include the following arguments:

-   `arrow =` to include some arrows 1mm in length

-   `end_cap =` and `start_cap =` to keep arrows from overlapping the nodes, and to

-   `alpha = .2` set the transparency of our edges so our edges fade more into the background and help keep the focus on our nodes:

```{r tweak-edges}
ggraph(student_network, layout = "stress") + 
  geom_node_point(aes(size = local_size(),
                      color = gender)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id),
                 repel=TRUE) +
  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, 'mm')), 
                 end_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 start_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 alpha = .2)
```

Note: There are many [different ways we can represent edges in a network](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-edges/) beyond simple links. Try replacing `geom_edge_link` with `geom_edge_arc` and see what happens!

#### Add a Theme

Finally, let's add a **theme,** which controls the finer points of display, like the font size and background color. The `theme_graph()` function add a theme specially tuned for graph visualizations. This function removes redundant elements in order to put focus on the data and if you type `?theme_graph` in the console you will get a sense of the level of fine tuning you can do if desired.

Let's add `theme_graph()` to our sociogram, remove the legends since they are not especially useful, and call it good for now:

```{r add-theme}
ggraph(student_network, layout = "stress") + 
  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, 'mm')), 
                 end_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 start_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 alpha = .1) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = local_size(),
                      color = gender)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id),
                 repel=TRUE) +
  theme_graph()
```

Much better! Notice also how we shifted the `geom_node_point()` layer of our graph to after the `geom_edge_link()` so the parts of nodes would not be hidden under the edges.

**Note:** If you're having difficulty seeing the sociogram in the small R Markdown code chunk, you can copy and paste the code in the console and it will show in the Viewer pan and then you can enlarge and even save as an image file.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Now that you have a sense of how the {ggraph} package works to build network graphs, use the code chunk below and try building sophisticated sociogram for the `teacher_network` object that you created above.

There are no right or wrong answers, just have some fun trying out different options for graph [layouts](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Layouts.html), [edges](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Edges.html) and [nodes](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Nodes.html) and see if you can build something that is visually pleasing to you.

```{r your-sociogram}
ggraph(teacher_network, layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, 'mm')), 
                 end_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 start_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 alpha = .2) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = local_size(),
                      color = gender)) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id),
                 repel=TRUE) +
  theme_graph()
```

Congrats, you made it to the end of the EXPLORE section and created your first sociogram in R!

## 4. MODEL

As highlighted in [Chapter 3 of Data Science in Education Using R](https://datascienceineducation.com/c03.html), the **Model** step of the data science process entails "using statistical models, from simple to complex, to understand trends and patterns in the data." We will not explore the use of models for SNA until Lab 4, but recall from the PREPARE section that to assess agreement between perceived friendships by the teacher and students, [@pittinsky2008behavioral] note that:

> **The QAP (quadratic assignment procedure)** \[is\] used to calculate the degree of association between two sets of relations and tests whether the probability of dyad overlap in the teacher matrix is correlated with the probability of dyad overlap in the student matrix. It does so by running a large number of simulations. These simulations generate random matrices with sizes and value distributions based on the original two matrices being tested.

We will learn more about the QAP and other models for statistical inference when working with relational data in Learning Lab 4.

## 5. COMMUNICATE

The final step in the workflow/process is sharing the results of your analysis with wider audience. For now, we will wrap up this case study by converting our work into a webpage that can be used to communicate your learning and demonstrate some of your new R skills. To do so, you will need to "knit" your document by clicking the ![](img/knit.png){width="10%"} button in the menu bar at that the top of this file. This will do two things; it will:

1.  check through all your code for any errors; and,

2.  create a file in your directory that you can use to share you work through [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/learn/guide#publish-from-cloud) (see screenshot example below to publish), [RPubs](#0) , [GitHub Pages](#0), [Quarto Pub](#0), or [other methods](#0).

### Knit and Publish

Complete the following steps to knit and publish your work:

1.  First, change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/rmarkdown-anatomy.html#yaml-metadata) at the very top of this document to your name. The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Next, click the knit button in the toolbar above to "knit" your R Markdown document to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder. You should see a formatted webpage appear in your Viewer tab in the lower right pan or in a new browser window. Let's us know if you run into any issues with knitting.

3.  Finally, publish your webpage on Posit Cloud by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane after you knit your document. See screenshot below.
