## Overview

Our primary goal in this unit is to build a basic understanding of
social network analysis (SNA) as an approach to understand and improve
learning processes and outcomes. The required and self-selected readings
provide an introduction to SNA in the field of education, including the
historical, theoretical, and analytical foundations of a social network
perspective.

A secondary goal of readings and discussion is to help you start
generating ideas for independent application of network analysis. As
part of our discussion, you'll be asked to generate a basic research
question about a population of interest and that could be answered using
relational data.

Course readings, discussion guidelines, and assessment criteria are
further described in [this
document](https://sbkellogg.github.io/eci-589/unit-1/unit-1-readings.html).
If you have any questions about this assignment, don't hesitate to send
me an email or schedule a time to talk at
[calendly.com/sbkellogg](calendly.com/sbkellogg).

## Readings

For Unit read chapters 1 and 2 from [Social Network Analysis and
Education](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU2803782)
[@carolan2014] and locate one additional research article, presentation,
or informal study to help address our discussion questions for the week.

### SNA and Education Part I: Theory and Concepts

The following readings for this unit illustrate how social network
analysis provides educational researchers with a different way of
thinking about and measuring an learning processes and outcomes by that
explicitly account for the importance of one's relationships with
others, as well as the larger pattern in which these relationships are
embedded.

### Self-Selected Study

Use the [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles), [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a
research or practitioner-focused article, presentation, or resource that
demonstrates the application of social network analysis to study a
context or topic of interest. You are also welcome to select one of the
research papers listed in
the [syllabus](https://sbkellogg.github.io/eci-589/) or in our [course
text](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU2803782) that may have
peaked your interest. Your selection should address one or more of the
discussion topics/questions (see below) and you're welcome to identify
SNA resources outside of the field of education.

## Discussion

In lieu of the peer interaction and discussion of course materials that
normally take place "in-class", you'll be asked to log in this
week and engage with other members of our learning community through
this discussion forum. **With the exception of the Self-Selected Study
questions, you are not required to address every guiding question**,
particularly if you feel others in the class have thoroughly addressed
the topic or questions. Our aim for these discussions is to collectively
build our understanding of these readings through back-and-forth
dialogue and avoid a "collective monologue" in which we see 20
variations of effectively the same post.

To create a new post in response to one or more of the guiding questions
listed below, click "Add a new discussion topic" located below the forum
overview text and add a descriptive title for the subject line. In the
message box, includes the question(s) your post is addressing, as well
as your response to the selected questions. Remember, you are not
required to address every guiding question with the exception of the
Self-Selected Study questions for which you must create one new
discussion topic and respond to the discussion prompt and required
questions.

### Guiding Questions

To help guide our discussions, we will collectively address a set of
guiding questions provided below. You are also welcome to add your own
topics or questions for the class to discuss.

#### Chapter 1: The Social Network Perspective and Educational Research Introduction

1.  Consider a network of which you are a part. Who are the network's
    actors? What ties connect these actors? Are there any groups within
    this network? What relations within this network might be of
    interest to a researcher? Finally, what makes this collection of
    actors a social network?

2.  Using the same question from the previous response, explain the
    analytical level at which these data would need to be collected and
    analyzed.

#### Chapter 2: Historical, Theoretical, and Analytical Foundations

Draft a research question for a population you may be interested in
studying, or that would be of interest to educational researchers, and
that would require the collection of relational data. Share your
research question and then answer the following questions:

1.  What relational data would need to be collected? 

2.  For what reason would relational data need to be collected in order
    to address this question?

3.  Explain the analytical level at which these data would need to be
    collected and analyzed.

4.  How does this differ from the ways in which individual or group
    behavior is typically conceptualized and modeled in conventional
    educational research?

#### Chapter 3: Basic Concepts

Refer to the graph below to answer the following questions:

1.  Is this graph directed or undirected? Are the lines arcs or edges?
    Given your responses to these questions, what type of relation might
    this graph represent?

2.  Based on what you see in this graph, is this relation valued or
    binary?

3.  What attribute data might you want to incorporate into analysis?

Bonus Questions:

Create a matrix that represents the relational data evident in the graph
and answer the following questions:

1.  How many actors are in this matrix?

2.  How many rows and columns are in this matrix?

3.  What type of data are in the cells of this matrix?

4.  Is this matrix symmetric? Explain the values on the diagonal of the
    matrix.

#### Self-Selected Study: The Four Hallmarks of SNA

**Required**

For your self-selected study, provide a APA citation and abstract, then
briefly answer the following questions:

1.  To what degree does the study emphasize one or more of the
    following:

    -   individuals and their actions are viewed as interdependent;

    -   relational ties between individuals are opportunities for
        transmission of resources;

    -   the pattern of relations among individuals---the social
        structure---is an environment that can provide either
        opportunities for or constraints on individual action; and (4)
        social structure as an enduring pattern of relations among
        actors?

2.  At which level are the social network data measured and collected:
    ego, dyad, triad, or complete?

3.  What relations have been measured among actors? Why were these
    relations measured and others excluded?

4.  How and to what degree does the study reflects the four hallmarks of
    social network analysis: 

    -   emphasis on structuralism based on ties among actors, 

    -   firmly grounded in empirical data, 

    -   use of graphical imagery, and 

    -   mathematically based.

Bonus Questions:

1.  How does the study straddle qualitative and quantitative paradigms?

2.  How does the use of the social network analysis bridge the gap
    between sociological theory and empirical reality?

## Assessment

Grading for this assignment is fairly lenient, provided that it's clear
from your posts that you've done the required reading. Readings and
discussion for each unit are worth 6 points and judged based on quantity
and quality of your posts.

In term of **quantity** (3 points), you'll be expected to create a new
discussion topic your self-selected study and add at least 3 new posts
and/or replies for a total of 4 posts. So others will have an
opportunity to read and respond to your posts, your posts should be
spread out over the course of the week and across at least two different
days, preferably not the last two days.

In terms of **quality** (3 points), your posts over the next week should
provide new or insightful contributions to that question or topic.
There is no requisite for the length of each posting, in fact short
conversational exchanges (1-3 paragraphs) are highly encouraged. I
strongly recommend taking a look at Table 1 of [the productive online
discussion
model](https://moodle-courses2122.wolfware.ncsu.edu/pluginfile.php/287931/mod_forum/post/6203/Gao%2C%20Wang%2C%20Sun%20-%202009%20-%20A%20new%20model%20of%20productive%20online%20discussion%20and%20its%20implications%20for%20research%20and%20instruction.pdf) [@gao2009]
for ways to contribute to the conversation. 

At minimum, your collective posts should also help us interpret or
elaborate on discussion topics, questions, or ideas others have shared
by "making connection to the learning materials" and should reference at
some point each of the required chapters and your self-selected reading
or resource.
