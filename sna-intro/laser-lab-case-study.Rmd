## 0. INTRODUCTION

![](img/LASER_Hx.png){width="40%"}

Welcome to your first LASER Learning Lab Case Study! The case study
activities included in each learning lab demonstrate how key Learning
Analytics (LA) techniques featured in exemplary STEM education research
studies can be implemented with R. Case studies also provide a holistic
setting to explore important foundational topics integral to Learning
Analytics such as reproducible research, use of APIs, and ethical use of
educational data.

This orientation case study will also introduce you to R Markdown, which
is heavily integrated into each LASER Learning Labs. You may have used R
Markdown before - or you may not have! Either is fine as this task will
be designed with the assumption that you have not used R Markdown
before.

In this interactive coding case study, we'll focus on the following
tasks:

1.  Reading data into R (in the **Prepare** section)
2.  Preparing and "wrangling" data in a tabular (think spreadsheet!)
    format (in the **Wrangle** section)
3.  Creating some basic plots (in the **Explore** section)
4.  Running a model - specifically, a simple regression model (in the
    **Model** section)
5.  Finally, creating a reproducible report of your work you can share
    with others (in the **Communicate** section)

### How to use this R Markdown document

What you are working in now is an [R
Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file as indicated by the .Rmd
file name extension. Following best practices for reproducible research
[@gandrud2021], R Markdown files store information in plain text
[markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html)
syntax. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and use a productive
[notebook interface](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html)
to combine narrative text and "chunks" of code to produce a range of
static or dynamic outputs formats including:
[HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html), [PDF](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html), [MS
Word](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/word-document.html), [HTML5
slides](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html), [Tufte-style
handouts](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/tufte-handouts.html),
[books](#0), [dashboards](#0), [shiny applications](#0), [scientific
articles](#0), [websites](#0), and more.

There are two keys to your use of R Markdown for this activity:

1.  First, be sure that you are viewing the document in the "Visual
    Editor" mode. You can use this mode by clicking the word "Visual" on
    the left side of the toolbar above. The visual editor allows you to
    view formatted headers, text and code chunks as specified by the
    underlying markdown syntax, or "Source" text. Visual mode is a bit
    more "human readable" than markdown syntax but definitely take a
    look at the source text.
2.  Second, note the specially formatted text box below called a "[code
    chunk](#0)." These chunks allows you to run code from [multiple
    languages](#0) including R, Python, and SQL. This specific code
    chunk contains a line of R code as specified by "r" inside the curly
    brackets `{}` where you can also include other "[chunk
    options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options)." You will
    also notice a set of buttons in the upper right corner for running
    the code.

Click the green arrow button on the right side of the code chunk to run
the R code and view the image file name `laser-cycle.png` stored in the
`img` folder in your files pane.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/laser-cycle.png")
```

### The Data-Intensive Research Workflow

You may have noticed that the words in this diagram correspond to the
sections outlined at the beginning of this documentt. These terms, or
processes, are part of a framework called the data-intensive research
workflow and comes from the book Learning Analytics Goes to School
[@krumm2018]*.* You can check that out later, but don't feel any need to
dive deep into it for now - we'll be spending more time on this
throughout the week; just know that this document and all of our LASER
Lab case studies are organized around these five components.

Now, let's get started!

## 1. PREPARE

First and foremost, data-intensive research involves defining and
refining a research question and developing an understanding of where
your data comes from [@krumm2018]. This part of the process also
involves setting up a reproducible research environment [@gandrud2021]
so your work can be understood and replicated by other researchers. For
now, we'll focus on just a few parts of this process, diving in much
more deeply into these components in later learning labs.

### Research Question

In this case study, we'll be working with data come from an unpublished
research study, which utilized a number of different data sources to
understand high schoole students' motivation within the context of
online courses. For the purpose of this case study, our analysis will be
driven by the following research question:

*Is there a relationship between the time students spend on a course (as
measured through their learning management system) and their final
course grade?*

### Packages 📦

As highlighted in [Chapter 6 of Data Science in Education Using
R](https://datascienceineducation.com/c06.html) [@estrellado2020e], one
of the first steps of every workflow should be to set up a "Project"
within RStudio.

> A **Project** is the home for all of the files, images, reports, and
> code that are used in any given project.

We are working in Posit Cloud with an R project [cloned from
GitHub](https://github.com/laser-institute/laser-orientation), so a
project has already been set up for you as indicated by the `.Rproj`
file in the main directory. Locate the Files tab lower right hand window
pane and see if you can find the file named `laser-orientation.Rproj`.

Since a project already set up for us, we will instead focus on loading
the required packages we'll need for analysis.

> **Packages**, sometimes referred to as libraries, are shareable
> collections of R code that can contain functions, data, and/or
> documentation and extend the functionality of R.

You can always check to see which packages have already been installed
and loaded into RStudio by looking at the Packages tab in the same pane
as the Files tab. Click the packages tab to see which packages have
already been installed for this project.

#### tidyverse 📦

![](img/tidyverse.png){width="30%"}

One package that we'll be using extensively in our learning labs is the
{tidyverse} package. The {tidyverse} is actually a [collection of R
packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed for wrangling and
exploring data (sound familiar?) and which all share an underlying
design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. These shared features
are sometimes referred to as "[tidy data
principles](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)" [@wickham2016r].

To load the tidyverse, we'll use the `library()` function. Go ahead and
run the code chunk below:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Please do not worry if you saw a number of messages: those probably mean
that the tidyverse loaded just fine. If you see an error, though, try to
interpret or search via your search engine the contents of the error, or
reach out to us for assistance.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

As we noted in the beginning, these case studies are meant to be
interactive. Throughout each case study, you'll see Your Turn headings
like the one above that will ask to you apply some of your R skills to
help with the analysis. These Your Turns are intended to help you
practice newly introduced functions or R code and reinforce R skills you
have already learned.

Use the code chunk below to load the {skimr} package into our
environment as well. **`Skimr`** is a handy package that provides
summary statistics that you can skim quickly to understand your data and
see what may be missing. We'll be using this later in the Explore
section of this case study.

```{r}
# load the {skimr} package below

```

### Loading (or reading in) data

The data we'll explore in this case study were originally collected for
a research study, which utilized a number of different data sources to
understand students' course-related motivation. These courses were
designed and taught by instructors through a state-wide online course
provider designed to supplement---but not replace---students' enrollment
in their local school.

The data used in this case study has already been "wrangled" quite a
bit, but the original datasets included:

1.  A self-report survey assessing three aspects of students' motivation

2.  Log-trace data, such as data output from the learning management
    system (LMS)

3.  Discussion board data

4.  Academic achievement data

If you are interested in learning more about these datasets, you can
visit Chapter 7 of the excellent book, [*Data Science in Education Using
R*](https://datascienceineducation.com/c07.html#data-sources)[@estrellado2020e].

Next, we'll load our data - specifically, a CSV text file, the kind that
you can export from Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets - into R, using the
`read_csv()` function in the next chunk.

Clicking the green arrow runs the code; do that next to read the
`sci-online-classes.csv` file stored in the `data` folder of your R
project:

```{r}
sci_data <- read_csv("data/sci-online-classes.csv")
```

Nice work! You should now see a new data "object" named `sci_data` saved
in your Environment pane. Try clicking on it and see what happens!

#### Viewing or inspecting data

Now let's learn another way to inspect our data. Run the next chunk and
look at the results, tabbing left or right with the arrows, or scanning
through the rows by clicking the numbers at the bottom of the pane with
the print-out of the data frame you "assigned" to the `sci_data` object
in the previous code-chunk:

```{r}
sci_data
```

**Note**: You can also enlarge this output by clicking the "Show in New
Window" button located in the top right corner of the output.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

What do you notice about this data set? What do you wonder? Add one or
two observations in the space below:

-   YOUR RESPONSE HERE

There are many other ways to inspect your data; the `glimpse()` function
provides one such way. Use the code chunk below to take a "glimpse" at
your `sci_data`.

```{r}
# take a glimpse at your data

```

We have one more question to pose to you: What do rows and columns
typically represent in your area of work and/or research?

Generally, rows typically represent "cases," the units that we measure,
or the units on which we collect data. This is not a trick question!
What counts as a "case" (and therefore what is represented as a row)
varies by (and within) fields. There may be multiple types or levels of
units studied in your field; listing more than one is fine! Also, please
consider what columns - which usually represent variables - represent in
your area of work and/or research.

What do rows typically (or you think may) represent in your research:

-   YOUR RESPONSE HERE

What do columns typically (or you think may) represent in your research:

-   YOUR RESPONSE HERE

Next, we'll use a few functions that are handy for preparing data in
table form.

## 2. WRANGLE

By wrangle, we refer to the process of cleaning and processing data,
and, in some cases, merging (or joining) data from multiple sources.
Often, this part of the process is very (surprisingly) time-intensive!
Wrangling your data into shape can itself be an important
accomplishment! And documenting your code using R scripts or Markdown
files will save yourself and others a great deal of time wrangling data
in the future! There are great tools in R for data wrangling, especially
through the use of the {[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)} R package
which is part of the tidyverse.

### Selecting variables

Recall from our Prepare section that we are interested the relationship
between the time students spend on a course and their final course
grade.

Let's practice selecting a few variables by introducing a very powerful
`|>` operator called a **pipe**. Pipes are a powerful tool for combining
a sequence of functions or processes.

Run the following code chunk to "pipe" our `sci_data` to the `select()`
function include the following two variables as arguments:

-   `FinalGradeCEMS` (i.e., students' final grades on a 0-100 point
    scale)

-   `TimeSpent` (i.e., the number of minutes they spent in the course's
    learning management system)

```{r}
sci_data |> 
  select(FinalGradeCEMS, TimeSpent)
```

Notice how the number of columns (variables) is now different!

Let's *include one additional variable* in the select function that you
think might be a predictor of students' final course grade or useful in
addressing our research question.

First, we need to figure out what variables exist in our dataset (or be
reminded of this - it's very common in R to be continually checking and
inspecting your data)!

Recall that you can use a function named `glimpse()` to do this.

```{r}
glimpse(sci_data)
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

In the code chunk below, add a new variable, being careful to type the
new variable name as it appears in the data. We've added some code to
get you started. Consider how the names of the other variables are
separated as you think about how to add an additional variable to this
code.

```{r}
sci_data |> 
  select(FinalGradeCEMS, TimeSpent)
```

Once added, the output should be different than in the code above -
there should now be an additional variable included in the print-out.

**A quick footnote about pipes**: The original pipe operator, `%>%`,
comes from the {[magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org)} package but
all packages in the tidyverse load `%>%` for you automatically, so you
don't usually load magrittr explicitly. The pipe has become such a
useful and much used operator in R that it is now baked into R using the
new and simpler native pipe `|>` operator. You can use both fairly
interchangeably but there are a few [differences between pipe
operators](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/04/base-vs-magrittr-pipe/).

### Filtering variables

Next, let's explore filtering variables. Check out and run the next
chunk of code, imagining that we wish to filter our data to view only
the rows associated with students who earned a final grade (as a
percentage) of 70 - 70% - or higher.

```{r}
sci_data |> 
  filter(FinalGradeCEMS > 70)
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

In the next code chunk, change the cut-off from 70% to some other
value - larger or smaller (maybe much larger or smaller - feel free to
play around with the code a bit!).

```{r}
sci_data |> 
  filter(FinalGradeCEMS > 70)
```

What happens when you change the cut-off from 70 to something else? Add
a thought (or more) below:

-   YOUR RESPONSE HERE

### Arrange

The last function we'll use for preparing tables is arrange. We'll again
use the `|>` to combine this `arrange()` function with a function we
used already - `select()`. We do this so we can view only time spent and
final grades.

```{r}
sci_data |> 
  select(FinalGradeCEMS, TimeSpent) |> 
  arrange(FinalGradeCEMS)
```

Note that arrange works by sorting values in ascending order (from
lowest to highest); you can change this by using the `desc()` function
as an argument with arrange, like the following:

```{r}
sci_data |> 
  select(FinalGradeCEMS, TimeSpent) |> 
  arrange(desc(FinalGradeCEMS))
```

Just at a quick cursory glance at our two variables, it does appear that
students with higher grades also tend to have spent more time in the
online course.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

In the code chunk below, replace `TimeSpent` that is used with both the
`select()` and `arrange()` functions with a different variable in the
data set. Consider returning to the code chunk above in which you
glimpsed at the names of all of the variables.

```{r}
sci_data |> 
  select(TimeSpent, FinalGradeCEMS) |> 
  arrange(desc(FinalGradeCEMS))
```

Can you compose a series of functions that include the `select()`,
`filter()`, and `arrange()` functions? Recall that you can "pipe" the
output from one function to the next as when we used select() and
arrange() together in the code chunk above.

*This is not required/necessary to complete; it's just for those who
wish to do a bit more with these functions at this time (we'll do more
in our learning labs , too!)*

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE



```

## 3. EXPLORE

Exploratory data analysis, or exploring your data, involves processes of
*describing* your data (such as by calculating the means and standard
deviations of numeric variables, or counting the frequency of
categorical variables) and, often, visualizing your data. As we'll learn
in later labs, the explore phase can also involve the process of
"feature engineering," or creating new variables within a dataset
[@krumm2018].

In this section, we'll quickly pull together some basic stats using a
handy function from the {skimr} package, and introduce you to a basic
data visualization "code template" for the {ggplot} package from the
tidyverse.

### Summary Statistics

Let's repurpose what we learned from our wrangle section to select just
a few variables and quickly gather some descriptive stats using the
`skim()` function from the {skimr} package.

```{r}
sci_data |>
  select(TimeSpent, FinalGradeCEMS) |>
  skim()
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Use the code from the chunk from above to explore some other variables
of interest from our `sci_data`.

```{r}
# use skim() to summarize other variables of your choosing

```

What happens if simply feed the skim function the entire `sci_data`
object? Give it a try!

```{r}
# use skim() on the entire data frame

```

### Data Visualization

Data visualization is an extremely common practice in Learning
Analytics, especially in the use of data dashboards. Data visualization
involves graphically representing one or more variables with the goal of
discovering patterns in data. These patterns may help us to answer
research questions or generate new questions about our data, to discover
relationships between and among variables, and to create or select
features for data modeling.

In this section we'll focus on using a basic code template for the
{[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)} package from the tidyverse.
`ggplot2` is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on [the
grammar of
graphics](https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html#what-is-the-grammar-of-graphics)
[@Wickham]. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to
[aesthetics](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.html), what
graphical elements to use, and it takes care of the details.

### The Graphing Workflow

At it's core, you can create some very simple but attractive graphs with
just a couple lines of code. {[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)}
follows the common workflow for making graphs. To make a graph, you
simply:

1.  Start the graph with `ggplot()` and include your data as an
    argument;

2.  "Add" elements to the graph using the `+` operator a [`geom_()`
    function](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#geoms);

3.  Select variables to graph on each axis with the `aes()` argument.

Let's give it a try by creating a simple histogram of our
`FinalGradeCEMS` variable. The code below creates a histogram, or a
distribution of the values, in this case for students' final grades. Go
ahead and run it:

```{r}
ggplot(sci_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = FinalGradeCEMS))
```

Note that the first function, `ggplot()`, creates a coordinate system
that you can "add" layers to using additional functions and `+`
operator. The first argument of `ggplot()` is the dataset, in our case
`sci_data`, to use for the graph.

By itself, `ggplot(data = mpg)` just creates an empty graph. But when
you add a required `geom_()` function like `geom_histogram()`, you tell
it which type of graph you want to make, in our case a histogram. A
**geom** is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent
observations. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the
plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line
geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots, which we'll
see a in bit, break the trend; they use the point geom.

The final required element for any graph is a `mapping =` argument that
defines which variables in your dataset are mapped to which axes in your
graph. The `mapping` argument is always paired with the function
`aes()`, which you use to gather together all of the mappings that you
want to create. In our case, since we just created a simple histogram,
we only had to specify what variable to place on the x axis, which in
our case was `FinalGradeCEMS`.

We won't spend a lot of time on it in this case study, but you can also
add a wide range of [aesthetic
arguments](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#aesthetics)
to each geom, like changing the color of the histogram bars by adding an
argument to specify color. Let's give that a try using the `fill =`
argument:

```{r}
ggplot(sci_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = FinalGradeCEMS), fill = "blue")
```

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Now use the code chunk below to visualize the distribution of another
variable in the data, specifically `TimeSpent`. You can do so by
swapping out the variable `FinalGradeCEMS` with our new variable. Also,
change the color to one of your choosing; consider this list of valid
color names here:
<http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf>

```{r}
# create a histogram of TimeSpent using a different color

```

**Tip:** There is no shame in copying and pasting code from above.
Remember, reproducible research is also intended to help you save time!

### Scatterplots

Finally, let's create a scatter plot for the relationship between these
two variables. Scatterplots use the point geom, i.e., the `geom_point()`
function, and are most useful for displaying the relationship between
two continuous variables.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Complete the code chunk below to create a simple scatterplot with
`TimeSpent` on the x axis and `FinalGradeCEMS` on the y axis. **Hint**:
something else important is also missing that you will need to "add" to
your code.

```{r}
ggplot(sci_data) 
  geom_point(aes(x = , 
                 y = ))
```

Well done! As you can see, there appears to be a positive relationship
between the time students spend in the online course and their final
grade!

To learn more about using {ggplot2} for data visualization, we highly
recommend the following Posit Cloud Primers:

1.  [Visualization Basics](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.1): Start
    here to begin making plots with R. Plots are one of the most
    important tools for data science; they are also one of the most fun!
2.  [Visualize Data](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3): Learn how to
    use ggplot2 to make any type of plot with your data. Then learn the
    best ways to visualize patterns within values and relationships
    between variables.

## 4. MODEL

"Model" is one of those terms that has many different meanings. For our
purpose, we refer to the process of simplifying and summarizing our
data. Thus, models can take many forms; calculating means represents a
legitimate form of modeling data, as does estimating more complex
models, including linear regressions, and models and algorithms
associated with machine learning tasks. For now, we'll run a base linear
regression model to further examine the relationship between `TimeSpent`
and `FinalGradeCEMS`.

We'll dive much deeper into modeling in subsequent learning labs, but
for now let's see if there is a statistically significant relationship
between students' final grades, `FinaGradeCEMS`, and the `TimeSpent` on
the course:

```{r}
m1 <- lm(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent, data = sci_data)

summary(m1)
```

It looks like `TimeSpent` is associated with a higher final grade. That
is, students who spent more time in the LMS also earned higher grades.

#### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Now let's "add" *another* variable to the regression model.
Specifically, use the `+` operator after `TimeSpent` to add the course
`subject` variable as a predictor of students' final grades.

```{r}
m2 <- lm(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent + subject, data = sci_data)
summary(m2)
```

What do you notice about the results? Add a comment or two below:

## 5. COMMUNICATE

The final step in the workflow/process is sharing the results of your
analysis with wider audience. Krumm et al. @krumm2018 have outlined the
following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders
findings from an analysis:

1.  **Select.** Communicating what one has learned involves selecting
    among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an
    intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that
    information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form,
    i.e. a "data product."

2.  **Polish**. After creating initial versions of data products,
    research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by
    adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with
    colors and shapes to highlight key points.

3.  **Narrate.** Writing a narrative to accompany the data products
    involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related
    research question, describing how best to interpret the data
    product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps
    answer the research question and might be used to inform new
    analyses or a "change idea" for improving student learning.

In later Learning Labs, you will have an opportunity to create a simple
"data product" designed to illustrate some insights gained from your
analysis and ideally highlight an action step or change idea that can be
used to improve learning or the contexts in which learning occurs.

For now, we will wrap up this case study by converting our work into a
webpage that can be used to communicate your learning and demonstrate
some of your new R skills. To do so, you will need to "knit" your
document by clicking the ![](img/knit.png){width="10%"} button in the
menu bar at that the top of this file. This will do two things; it will:

1.  check through all your code for any errors; and,

2.  create a file in your directory that you can use to share you work
    through [Posit
    Cloud](https://posit.cloud/learn/guide#publish-from-cloud) (see
    screenshot example below to publish), [RPubs](#0) , [GitHub
    Pages](#0), [Quarto Pub](#0), or [other methods](#0).

### Knit and Publish

Complete the following steps to knit and publish your work:

1.  First, change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML
    header](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/rmarkdown-anatomy.html#yaml-metadata)
    at the very top of this document to your name. The YAML header
    controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't
    actually display in the final output.

2.  Next, click the knit button in the toolbar above to "knit" your R
    Markdown document to a
    [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file
    that will be saved in your R Project folder. You should see a
    formatted webpage appear in your Viewer tab in the lower right pan
    or in a new browser window. Let's us know if you run into any issues
    with knitting.

3.  Finally, publish your webpage on on Posit Cloud by clicking the
    "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane after you knit your
    document. See screenshot below.
