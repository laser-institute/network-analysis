# Top-Down Methods

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Overview]

The “top-down” approach focuses on how larger network structures are built from smaller ones. Or stated more clearly:

&gt; ...this approach takes the complete network and considers parts of it that are dense and somewhat distinct from the rest of the network.

]


.panel[.panel-name[Components]

.pull-left[
A **component** is a connected subgraph in which there is a path between all pairs of nodes.

]
]
]


.panel[.panel-name[Bi-Components]

.pull-left[
**Bi-components** help to identify the important “weak” spots and ask what would happen to the network if an actor were removed. 

Nodes that result in new components are referred to as “cutpoints” and are often important actors. 

]

&lt;img src="sna-lab-3-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="70%" /&gt;
]
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Factions]

.pull-left[
A **faction** is a group with more ties within than across group even those group boundaries are somewhat porous. 

Factions are identified by various [community detection algorithms](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/index.html#section-community-detection) to represent these structural sub-communities.

# Bottom-Up Methods

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Overview]
Like top-down methods, this approach is also concerned with how larger structures are composed of smaller groups of actors. However... 


&gt; Bottom-up approaches identify groups that are **built up from simple dyads and triads** that extend into dense clusters that give the network its “clumpiness.” 


]


.panel[.panel-name[Cores]


A **K-core** is a substructure (a subgraph) of the network in which each node within the K-core is connected to at least K other nodes. Therefore, a 2K-core would be a subset of actors in which a node is connected to two others. 

.center[&lt;img src="img/k-core.png" height="200px"/&gt;

]]
]





.panel[.panel-name[Cliques]

.pull-left[
A **n-clique** is a maximally connected subgraph of nodes (&gt; 2) in which all nodes are connected to each other.

Which a clique in the graph to the right? K-core? Isolate?

]

.panel[.panel-name[Clans]

Actors in the same **clan** are all connected at n distance, n (or less), and all actors in between are also members of the same clan.

# Discuss

Think about a network you are a part of or may be interested in studying and consider the following questions: 

1. What groups might exist in this network? 

1. How might you go about identifying them? 

1. How might this information be useful? 

???

# Guiding Study

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Context]

.pull-left[
Our third SNA learning lab is inspired by the [#commoncore Project](https://www.hashtagcommoncore.com), which examined the intense debate surrounding the Common Core State Standards education reform as it played out on Twitter.
]

.pull-right[

.center[&lt;img src="img/commoncore.jpg" height="300px"/&gt;]
]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Questions]

The central question guiding the #COMMONCORE Project was:

&gt; How are social media-enabled social networks changing the discourse in American politics that produces and sustains education policy?

]

.panel[.panel-name[Data]
- The authors used Twitter's Application Programming Interface (API) based on tweets using specified keywords, keyphrases, or hashtags and then restricted their analysis to the following terms: commoncore, ccss and stopcommoncore. 

- They also captured Twitter profile names, or user names, as well as the tweets, retweets, and mentions posted.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Key Findings]

- In Act 1, The Giant Network, the authors **identified five major sub-communities**, or factions, including: (1) supporters, (2) opponents inside education, and (3) opponents outside of education.

- In Act 2, Central Actors, they noted that most of these participants were casual contributors and distinguished between two types of **central actors** on Twitter: Transmitters and Transceivers.

Network Packages, Objects, and Sociograms

# Import Data

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Load Libraries]

Let's start by creating a new R script and loading the {tidyverse}, as well as the {tidygraph} and {ggraph} SNA packages introduced in Lab 1:          


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
library(igraph)
```

**Note:** You may have to install this package using the `install.packages()` function if it is not listed in your packages pane.  
]

.panel[.panel-name[Import Data]

Run the following code to use the `read_csv()` function from the {readr} package to read the `ccss-tweets-fresh.csv` file from the data folder and assign to a new data frame named ccss_tweets:


```r
ccss_ties &lt;- read_csv("data/ccss-edgelist.csv")

ccss_nodes &lt;- read_csv("data/ccss-nodelist.csv")
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Inspect Data]

Now let's take a look at the data file we just imported using the `View()` function or another function of choice you may have learned in the Foundations Labs:


```r
View(ccss_ties)

View(ccss_nodes)
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]

Think about the questions below and be prepared to share your response:              
1. What do you think the rows and columns in each file represent? 

1. What about the values in each cell represent?

1. What else do you notice about the data? 

1. What questions do you have? 

]

]

# Tidy Graph  

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[tbl_graph( ) function]

The [`tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) function creates a special network data structure called a "tidy graph" that combines our nodes and edges into a single R object. Run the following code in your R script:


```r
ccss_network &lt;- tbl_graph(edges = ccss_ties,
                          nodes = ccss_nodes, 
                          directed = TRUE) 
```
The benefits of a "tidy graph" is that opens up the entire suite of tidyverse tools for manipulating and constructing network data and variables noted earlier. 

]

.panel[.panel-name[View Network]


Using your R script, type the name of network object we just created and run the code to produce the output on the next tab:


```r
# ADD CODE BELOW
#
#
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[View Sociogram]



```r
ggraph(ccss_network, layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(1, 'mm')), 
                 end_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 start_cap = circle(3, 'mm'),
                 alpha = .1) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = local_size())) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = actors,
                     size = local_size()),
                 repel=TRUE) +
  theme_graph()
```

]

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]

Think about the questions below:              

1. What is size of our CSSS twitter network?

1. Does our network contain any obvious groups?

1. What insights have gained about out network so far?

1. What questions do have about have about out network so far?

# Components

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Definition]

One of the most basic ways researchers can characterize a network's substructure is to identify its components.

&gt; A **component** is a connected subgraph in which there is a path between all pairs of nodes.

Recall from our output above that our directed "multigraph" had 13 components. 

]

.panel[.panel-name[Quick Look]

A weak component, as illustrated by the graph generated by the code below, ignores the direction of a tie; 


```r
autograph(ccss_network)
```

Strong components do not. In other words:

&gt; **Strong components** consist of nodes that are connected to one another via both directions along the path that connects them.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Implementation]
The {igraph} package has a simple `components()` function for identifying the number of components in a network, the size of each component, and which actors belong to each.


```r
components(ccss_network, mode = c("strong"))
```

How many "strong" components are in our network?
]



]


---
# Cliques

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Definition]

Examining cliques is one bottom-up approach that reveals how groups are distributed in the network and which actors belong to which groups.

&gt; A clique is a maximally connected subgraph of nodes (&gt; 2) in which all nodes are connected to each other. 


]

.panel[.panel-name[Clique Number]

Similar to our component analysis, the {igraph} function has a super simple `clique_num()` function for identifying number of completely connected subgroups in a network:


```r
clique_num(ccss_network)
```

As you probably saw above, the `clique_num()` function does not take into account directionality of our ties. It looks like we have 3 clusters of at least 3 actors that all have ties to one another.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Implementation]
The {igraph} function also has a simple `cliques()` function for
identifying members who belong to the same group.

Let's see if there are any cliques that contain a minimum of 4 nodes?


```r
cliques(ccss_network, min = 4, max = NULL)
```

```
## Warning in cliques(ccss_network, min = 4, max = NULL): At
## core/cliques/cliquer_wrapper.c:57 : Edge directions are ignored for clique
## calculations.
```

]

# Key Actors

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Degree]

As we learned in our previous lab, a key structural
property of networks is the concept of centralization. 

One of the most common descriptives reported in network studies and a
primary measure of centralization is degree.

&gt; **Degree** is the number of ties to and from an ego. In a directed
&gt; network, in-degree is the number of ties received, whereas out-degree
&gt; is the number of ties sent.


]

.panel[.panel-name[Activate Nodes]

The {tidygraph} package has an aptly named function
`centrality_degree()` for calculating degree, in-degree, and out-degree
for all actors in a network. 

To use it, we'll need to `activate()` our `nodes` and create a new node-level variable using `mutate()` from the {dplyr}


```r
ccss_network &lt;- ccss_network |&gt;
  activate(nodes) |&gt;
  mutate(in_degree = centrality_degree(mode = "in"),
         out_degree = centrality_degree(mode = "out"))
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[View Network]
Let's take a look at our network now. 


```r
ccss_network
```

```

.panel[.panel-name[Your Turn]
Using your R script, see if you can figure out which twitter user received the most replies/mentions (transceivers) and which user replied/mentioned to the most users (transmitters):
