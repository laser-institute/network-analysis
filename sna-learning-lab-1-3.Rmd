# 1. PREPARE

During the second week of each unit, we'll **"walk through"** a basic
research workflow, or data analysis process, modeled after the
Data-Intensive Research Workflow from [Learning Analytics Goes to
School](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU4862134) (Krumm et al.,
2018):

![](img/workflow.png){width="80%"}

Each walkthrough will focus on a basic analysis guided by the social
network perspective. This week, our focus will be on preparing
relational data for analysis, putting together some basic network
descriptives, and plotting a network visualization to help illustrate
key findings.

Specifically, the Unit 1 Walkthrough will cover the following topics:

1.  **Prepare**: Prior to analysis, we'll take a look at the context
    from which our data came, formulate some research questions, and get
    introduced the {igraph} R package for network analysis.

2.  **Wrangle**: Wrangling data entails the work of manipulating,
    cleaning, transforming, and merging data. In section 2 we focus on
    importing network data, converting our familiar data frames into a
    network object that can be analyzed and graphed, and learn about
    "simple graphs."

3.  **Explore**: In section 3, we calculate some basic network
    descriptives and learn how to illustrate some of these stats through
    network visualization.

4.  **Model**: While we won't dig into approaches for modeling network
    data until Unit 3, we will take a quick look at some approaches used
    in the study guiding this walkthrough.

5.  **Communicate**: We'll learn more about communicating key findings
    next week, but for now you will be introduced to the basic
    components of a data product.

## 1a. Review the Research

In [Social Network Analysis and Education: Theory, Methods &
Applications](https://methods.sagepub.com/book/social-network-analysis-and-education),
Carolyn (2013) notes that:

> the **social network perspective** is one concerned with the structure
> of relations and the implication this structure has on individual or
> group behavior and attitudes

More specifically, Carolyn cites the following four features used by
Freeman (2004) to define the social network perspective:

1.  Social network analysis is **motivated by a relational intuition**
    based on ties connecting social actors.

2.  It is firmly **grounded in systematic empirical data**.

3.  It **makes** **use of graphic imagery** to represent actors and
    their relations with one another.

4.  It **relies** **on** **mathematical and/or computational models** to
    succinctly represent the complexity of social life.

For Unit 1, our walkthrough will be guided by previous research and
evaluation work conducted by the Friday Institute for Educational
Innovation as part of the Massively Open Online Courses for Educators
(MOOC-Ed) initiative. The study introduced next and the hands-on
analysis with R in this walkthrough will help to illustrate these four
defining features of the social network perspective.

### A Social Network Perspective in MOOC-Eds

![](img/irrodl-article.png){width="30%"}

Kellogg, S., Booth, S., & Oliver, K. (2014). [A social network
perspective on peer supported learning in MOOCs for
educators](https://github.com/sbkellogg/eci-589/blob/main/unit-1/lit/sna_mooc_irrodl_bjet_articles.pdf). *International
Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning*, *15*(5), 263-289.

#### Research Context

In the spring of 2013, The Friday Institute launched the MOOC-Ed
Initiative to explore the potential of delivering personalized,
high-quality professional development to educators at scale (Kleiman et
al., 2013). In collaboration with the Alliance for Excellent Education,
the Friday Institute launched this initiative with a 6-week pilot course
called Planning for the Digital Learning Transition in K-12 Schools (DLT
1), which was offered again in September 2013 (DLT 2). This course was
designed to help school and district leaders plan and implement K-12
digital learning initiatives.

Academics, as well as pundits from traditional and new media, have
raised a number of concerns about MOOCs, including the lack of
instructional and social supports. Among the core design principles of
MOOC-Eds are collaboration and peer-supported learning. It is an
assumption of this study that challenges arising form this problem of
scale can be addressed by leveraging these massive numbers to develop
robust online learning communities.

This mixed-methods case study used both SNA and qualitative methods to
better understand peer support in MOOC-Eds through an examination of the
characteristics, mechanisms, and outcomes of peer networks. Findings
from this study demonstrate that even with technology as basic as a
discussion forum, MOOCs can be leveraged to foster these networks and
facilitate peer-supported learning. Although this study was limited to
two unique cases along the wide spectrum of MOOCs, the methods applied
provide other researchers with an approach for better understanding the
dynamic process of peer supported learning in MOOCs.

#### Data Sources

**MOOC-Ed registration form.** All participants completed a registration
form for each MOOC-Ed course. The registration form consists of
self-reported demographic data, including information related to their
professional role and work setting, years of experience in education,
and personal learning goals.

**MOOC-Ed discussion forums.** All peer interaction, including peer
discussion, feedback, and reactions (e.g., likes), take place within the
forum area of MOOC-Eds, which are powered by Vanilla Forums. Because of
the specific focus on peer supported learning, postings to or from
course facilitators and staff were removed from the data set. Finally,
analyses described below exclude more passive forms of interactions
(i.e., read and reaction logs), and include only postings among peers.

For our Unit 1 walkthrough, we'll take a look at data from the original
Digital Learning Transition in K-12 Schools (DLT 1) that was not
included in this study to allow for comparisons to the findings in this
study. For your independent analysis next week, you may want to consider
working with the DLT 2 data to see if you can replicate some of the
findings from this paper!

**Note**: In the data we're using, instructors have not yet been removed
and only direct replies to forum posts have been included, though
"weaker" ties like reactions with emoticons and even views of posts were
captured in this study.

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Take a quick look at the *Description of the Dataset* section from the
[Massively Open Online Course for Educators (MOOC-Ed) network
dataset](https://github.com/sbkellogg/eci-589/blob/main/unit-1/lit/bjet_12312_Rev.pdf)
BJET article and the accompanying data sets stored on [Harvard
Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZZH3UB)
that we'll be using for this walkthrough.

In the space below, type a brief response to the following questions:

1.  What were some of the steps necessary to construct this dataset?

    -   

2.  What two "node attributes" from the dataset that might be useful for
    predicting participants who may be more engaged or central to the
    network? Why did you select those two?

    -   

3.  What else do you notice/wonder about this dataset?

    -   

## 1b. Identify a Question(s)

A Social Network Perspective on Peer Supported Learning in MOOC-Eds was
framed by three primary research questions related to peer supported
learning:

1.  What are the patterns of peer interaction and the structure of peer
    networks that emerge over the course of a MOOC-Ed?

2.  To what extent do participant and network attributes (e.g.,
    homophily, reciprocity, transitivity) account for the structure of
    these networks?

3.  To what extent do these networks result in the co-construction of
    new knowledge?

For our very first walkthrough, we are going to focus exclusively on RQ1
from the original study and our question of interest about our
discussion network is:

> To what extent, did educators engage with other participants in the
> discussion forums?

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Based on what you know about networks and the context so far, what other
research questions might ask we ask in this context that a social
network perspective might be able to answer?

We'll revisit your response towards the end and provide an opportunity
to refine your research question after you know the data a little
better.

## 1c. Load Libraries

As highlighted in [Chapter 6 of Data Science in Education Using
R](https://datascienceineducation.com/c06.html#c06p) (DSIEUR):

> Packages are shareable collections of R code that can contain
> functions, data, and/or documentation. Packages increase the
> functionality of R by providing access to additional functions to suit
> a variety of needs.

You can always check to see which packages have already been installed
and loaded into RStudio Cloud by looking at the the Files, Plots, &
Packages Pane in the lower right hand corner of RStudio as shown in the
following screenshot:

![](img/packages-pane.png){width="90%"}

You should see installed some familiar tidytext packages from our
[Getting Started
Walkthrough](https://sbkellogg.github.io/eci-589/unit-0/unit-0-walkthrough.html)
like {dplyr} and {readr} which we'll be using again shortly. You should
also see an important package call {igraph} that we will rely on heavily
for our network analyses in this course.

If you are working in RStudio Desktop, or notice that the packages have
not been installed and/or loaded, run the following `install.packages()`
function code to install the {tidyverse} and {igraph} packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("igraph") 
```

Let's go ahead and use the `library()` function for the {tidyverse}
package and review which packages from the [tidyverse collection of
packages](https://www.tidyverse.org) that this package also loads.

Click the green arrow to run the following code and load our packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### 🎉 igraph Package **📦**

![](img/igraph.png){width="30%"}

For our Unit 1 Walkthrough, we will rely heavily on the [igraph network
analysis package](https://igraph.org). The main goals of the igraph
package and the collection of network analysis tools it contains are to
provide a set of data types and functions for:

1.  pain-free implementation of graph algorithms,

2.  fast handling of large graphs, with millions of vertices (i.e.,
    actors or nodes) and edges,

3.  allowing rapid prototyping via high level languages like R.

Run the code chunk below to load the {igraph} library:

```{r}
library(igraph)
```

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Take a look at the messages from the output after loading the igraph
library. What tidyverse packages share identically named functions with
igraph?

Write your response in the space below.

# 2. WRANGLE

In general, data wrangling involves some combination of cleaning,
reshaping, transforming, and merging data (Wickham & Grolemund, 2017).
The importance of data wrangling is difficult to overstate, as it
involves the initial steps of going from the raw data to a dataset that
can be explored and modeled (Krumm et al, 2018).

For our data wrangling this week, we're keeping it simple since working
with network data is a bit of a departure from our working with
rectangular data frames. Our primary goals for Unit 1 are learning how
to:

a.  **Import Data**. An obvious and also important first step, we need
    to "read" our data into R and learn about formatting for edge-lists
    and node attribute files.

b.  **Create a Network Object**. Before performing network analyses,
    we'll need to convert our data frames into special data format for
    working with relational data.

c.  **Simplify Network**. Finally, we'll learn about a handy
    `simplify()` function in the {igraph} package for collapsing
    multiple ties between actors and removing "self-loops."

## 2a. Import Data

### The Edge-List Format

To get started, we need to import, or "read", our data into R. The
function used to import your data will depend on the file format of the
data you are trying to import, but R is pretty adept at working with
many files types.

Take a look in the `/data` folder in your Files pane. You should see the
following .csv files:

-   `dlt1-edgelist.csv`

-   `dlt1-nodes.csv`

As its name implies, the first file `dlt1-edgelist.csv` is an edge-list
that contains information about each tie, or relation between two actors
in a network. In this context, a "tie" is a reply by one participant in
the discussion forum to the post of another participant -- or in some
cases to their own post! These ties between a single actor are called
"self-loops" and as we'll see later in this section, igraph has a
special function to remove these self loops from a sociogram, or network
visualization.

The edge-list format is slightly different than other formats you have
likely worked with before in that the values in the first two columns
each row represent a dyad, or tie between two nodes in a network. An
edge-list can also contain other information regarding the strength,
duration, or frequency of the relationship, sometime called "weight", in
addition to other "edge attributes."

In addition to our `Sender` and `Reciever` dyad pairs, our DLT 1 dataset
contains the following edge attributes:

-   `Sender` = Unique identifier of author of comment

-   `Receiver` = Unique identifier of identified recipient of comment

-   `Timestamp` = Time post or reply was posted

-   `Parent` = Primary category or topic of thread

-   `Category` = Subcategory or subtopic of thread

-   `Thread_id` = Unique identifier of a thread

-   `Comment_id` = Unique identifier of a comment\\

Let's use the `read_csv()` function from the {readr} package introduced
in the Getting Started walkthrough to read in our edge-list and print
the new `ties` data frame:

```{r}
ties <- read_csv("data/dlt1-edgelist.csv", 
                 col_types = cols(Sender = col_character(), 
                                  Receiver = col_character(), 
                                  `Category Text` = col_skip(), 
                                  `Comment ID` = col_character(), 
                                  `Discussion ID` = col_character()))

ties
```

Note the addition of the `col_types =` argument for changing the column
types to character strings since the numbers for those particular
columns indicate actors (`Sender` and `Reciever`) and attributes
(`Comment_ID` and `Discussion_Id`). We also skipped the `Category Text`
since this was left blank for deidentification purposes.

**RStudio Tip:** Importing data and dealing with data types can be a bit
tricky, especially for beginners. Fortunately, RStudio has an "Import
Dataset" feature in the Environment Pane that can help you use the
{readr} package and associated functions to greatly facilitate this
process.

![](img/import-data.png)

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Consider the example pictured below of a discussion thread from the
Planning for the Digital Learning Transition in K-12 Schools (DLT 1)
where our data orginated. This thread was initiated by participant I, so
the comments by J and N are considered to be directed at I. The comment
of B, however, is a direct response to the comment by N as signaled by
the use of the quote-feature as well as the explicit mentioning of N's
name within B's comment.

![](img/discussion-thread.png)

Now answer the following questions as they relate to the DLT 1 edge-list
we just read into R.

1.  Which actors in this thread are the `Sender` and the `Reciever`?
    Which actor is both?

    -   

2.  How many dyads are in this thread? Which pairs of actors are dyads?

    -   

**Sidebar:** Unfortunately, these types of nuances in discussion forum
data as illustrated by this simple example are rarely captured through
automated approaches to constructing networks. Fortunately, the dataset
you are working with was carefully reviewed to try and capture more
accurately the intended recipients of each reply.

### Node Attributes

The second file we'll be using contains all the nodes or actors (i.e.,
participants who posted to the discussion forum) as well as some of
their attributes such as gender and years of experience in education.

Carolyn (2013) notes that most social network analyses include variables
that describe attributes of actors, ones that are either categorical
(e.g., sex, race, etc.) or continuous in nature (e.g., test scores,
number of times absent, etc.). These attributes that can be incorporated
into a network graph or model, making it more informative and can aid in
testing or generating hypotheses.

These attribute variables are typically included in a rectangular array,
or dataframe, that mimics the actor-by-attribute that is the dominant
convention in social science, i.e. rows represent cases, columns
represent variables, and cells consist of values on those variables.

As an aside, Carolyn also refers to this historical preference by
researchers for "actor-by-attribute" data, in the absence of relational
data in which the actor has been removed their social context, as the
"sociological meatgrinder" in action. Specifically, this historical
approach assumes that the actor does not interact with anyone else in
the study and that outcomes are solely dependent of the characteristics
of the individual.

Regardless, let's read in our node attribute file and take a look at the
`actors` and their attributes included in our dataset:

```{r}
actors <- read_csv("data/dlt1-nodes.csv", 
                   col_types = cols(UID = col_character(), 
                                    Facilitator = col_character(), 
                                    expert = col_character(), 
                                    connect = col_character()))
```

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Use the code chunk below and a function of your choosing to take a look
at the `actors` data frame:

```{r}

```

Match up the attributes included in the node file with the following
codebook descriptors. The first one has been done as an example.

-   `Facilitator` = Identification of course facilitator (1 **=**
    instructor)
-   Dummy variable for whether participants listed
    networking/collaboration with others as one of their course goals on
    the registration form
-   Identifier of "expert panelists" invited to course to share
    experience through recorded Q&A
-   Identification of course facilitator (1 **=** instructor)
-   Professional role (eg, teacher, librarian, administrator)
-   Years of experience as an educator
-   Works with elementary, middle, and/or high school students
-   Initial assignment of discussion group

## 2b. Create Network Object

Before we can begin using many of the functions from the {igraph}
package for summarizing and visualizing our DLT 1 network, we first need
to convert the data frames that we imported into an igraph network
object, or an igraph graph. 🤷‍♂

### Convert to igraph Graph

To do that, we will use the `graph_from_data_frame()` function. Note
that I included the `eval=FALSE` argument in the code block below to
prevent this code from running when we knit our final document.
Otherwise it will produce an error since we can't include help
documentation in our knitted HTML file.

Run the following code to take a look at the help documentation for this
function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?graph_from_data_frame
```

You probably saw that this particular function takes the following three
arguments, two of which are data frames:

-   **d** describes the edges of the network. The first two columns are
    the IDs of the source and the target node for each edge, in our case
    the `Sender` and `Reviever` of a discussion post -- the order
    matters! The following columns are edge attributes such as weight,
    type, label, or anything else.

-   **vertices** starts with a column of node IDs and any following
    columns are interpreted as node attributes.

-   **directed** determines whether or not to create a directed graph.

Run the following code to specify our `ties` data frame as the edges of
our network, our `actors` data frame for the vertices of our network and
their attributes, and indicate that this is indeed a directed network.

```{r}
network <- graph_from_data_frame(d = ties, 
                                 vertices = actors, 
                                 directed = T) 

network
```

Carolyn (2013) reminds us that one of the simplest and often ignored
structural property of a social network is its size and explains that:

> **size** is simply a measure of the number of nodes in the network.

He notes that the size of a network plays an important role in
determining what happens in the network. For example, in a classroom of
30 students, it is not hard to imagine that the pattern of who
communicates with whom will look much different than if the network
consisted of hundreds or even thousands of students like in a MOOC.

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Take a look at the very first line of the output which contains some
basic information about our network and answer the following questions:

1.  How many nodes and edges are in our network? Is this consistent with
    the number of observations in our data frames? **Hint:** Check the
    Environment pane.

    -   

2.  The "D" and the "N" indicate that this is a **D**irected network and
    has the **N**ame vertex attributes set. Why do the two spaces that
    follow these letters have dashes? **Hint:** check the help files.

    -   

3.  Which vertex attribute did igraph interpret as numeric?

    -   

### Simplify Graph

As you saw from the `network` output, our dataset has 2529 edges or ties
and just a quick scan of the edges in the network shows that edges like
356 -\> 444 occur at least more than once. So we know that participant
356 has replied to participant 444 at least twice.

Fortunately, the {igraph} package has a `simplify()` function for
collapsing multiple edges so they are not represented more than once
when we want visually depict our network with a sociogram.

Let's use that function to simplify our network and save it as a
`simple_network,` or a simple graph, which contains no self-loops or
duplicate edges and which by default the `simplify()` function removes:

```{r}
simple_network <- simplify(network, remove.loops = TRUE) 

simple_network
```

Note that `simplify()` removes self-loops by default, this does not
really need to be included. If you wanted to keep them, you would simply
set this to `FALSE`.

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Take a look at the output for our simple graph now and answer the
following questions:

1.  How many unique edges are in the network? Why do you think this is
    considerably less than our total edges?

    -   

2.  Did we potentially lose any important or useful information by
    collapsing multiple edges into a single edge or by removing
    self-loops?

    -   

### Add Edge Weights

We noted earlier that edges can also contain attributes such as
strength, duration or frequency, sometime called "weight." These weights
can not only help us better understand the relationship between two
actors, but also aid in visualization and modeling later on.

When we used the `simplify()` function earlier, it collapsed our
duplicate edges but we lost some vital information as a result, namely
the frequency of replies among pairs of educators in our discussion
forum.

Fortunately, the `simplify()` function contains an argument that will
allow us to count the number of ties between two actors, similar to how
we might use the `count()` function in the {dplyr} package like so:

```{r}
edge_weights <- count(ties, Sender, Receiver)

edge_weights
```

In this case, we see that participant 1 replied to participant 144 twice
throughout the course.

To add weights to our simplified network, we first need to add a
`weight` variable to the edges in our original `network` igraph object.

The {igraph} package has a unique syntax for working with attributes of
network objects. To add a weight attribute to the `E()` edges in our
`network` we'll use the `$` operator which can be used to create a new
`weight` variable -- or select a variable as we'll see later on -- and
we'll use the `<-` assignment operator to add an initial value of `1`
for the weight of each edge.

Let's put that all together and run the code to add a weight of 1 to
each edge in our network

```{r}
E(network)$weight <- 1  
```

Now let's take a look at our igraph network object again:

```{r}
network
```

We can see that our network is now weighted as indicated by the "W" and
that our new `weight` attribute has been added.

We can now use the `edge.attr.comb =` argument to "sum" the weights for
each occurrence of a pair of actors, so if 1 replied to participant 144
five times over the course of the MOOC-Ed, there would be a weight of 5
for that pair.

Run the code to simplify our weighted network:

```{r}
weighted_network <- simplify(network,
                             edge.attr.comb = list(weight="sum")
                             )
```

Let's take a look at the output and ignore the error message for now:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
weighted_network
```

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Take a look at the output for our simple graph now and answer the
following questions:

1.  How does the number of total edges and unique edges this compare to
    the totals reported for the DLT 2 course in our [guiding
    study](https://github.com/sbkellogg/eci-589/blob/main/unit-1/lit/sna_mooc_irrodl_bjet_articles.pdf)?

# 3. EXPLORE

As noted in the Getting Started Walkthrough, exploratory data analysis
involves the processes of describing your data (such as by calculating
the means and standard deviations of numeric variables, or counting the
frequency of categorical variables) and, often, visualizing your data
prior to modeling.

In Section 3, we will learn some new functions for retrieving basic
network descriptives related to our research question and create a
network visualization to help illustrate key findings. Specifically, in
this section we'll learn to:

a.  **Examine Basic Descriptives**. We focus primarily on actors and
    edges in this walkthrough, including the edges wights we added in
    the previous section as well as node degree, and import and fairly
    intuitive measure of centrality.

b.  **Make a Sociogram**. Finally, we wrap up the explore phases by
    learning to plot a network and tweak key elements like the size,
    shape, and position of nodes and edges to better at communicating
    key findings.

## 3a. Examine Basic Descriptives

Many analyses of social networks are primarily descriptive. As Carolyn
(2013) notes that these descriptive studies aim either to represent the
network's underlying social structure through data-reduction techniques
or to characterize network properties through network measures.

### Node Degree

A key structural property of networks is the concept of centralization.
A network that is highly centralized is one in which relations are
focused on a small number of actors or even a single actor in a network,
whereas ties in a decentralized network are diffuse and spread over a
number of actors. One of the most common descriptives reported in
network studies and a primary measure of centralization is **degree**.

> Degree is the number of ties to and from an ego. In a directed
> network, in-degree is the number of ties received, whereas out-degree
> is the number of ties sent.

The {igraph} package has an aptly named function `degree()` for
retrieving degree, in-degree, and out-degree for all actors in a
network.

Run the following code to extract measures and save to `node_degree`
which we'll examine in just a bit:

```{r}
node_degree <- degree(weighted_network, mode = "all")
```

**Note**. We set the `mode =` argument in this function to "all" which
give us the total number of participants that each actor in our network
with sent or received a reply.

Let's take a look at the distribution of `node_degree` in our network by
using R's built in `hist()` function for creating histograms. I set the
value of `breaks =`, or bins in our histogram, to 30 since I already
know some actors in this network have a very high degree.

```{r}
hist(node_degree, breaks = 30)
```

We can see that most actors in the network are connected to very few
individuals while a couple actors in this network are connected to a
very larger number, nearly 200 and 350 respectively!

Now let's take a look at the mean and median for `node_degree` using
some other {base} R functions:

```{r}
mean(node_degree)
median(node_degree)
```

We see that the mean suggests the participants are, on average,
connected to about 8 other participants in the MOOC-Ed, but this is
likely heavily skewed by the two individuals with a disproportionate
number of connections. The median is probably a better characterization
of the typical number of educators a participant has sent or received a
reply.

#### In-Degree

Let's go ahead and take a look at in-degree next:

```{r}
in_degree <- degree(weighted_network, mode="in")

hist(in_degree, breaks = 30)
mean(in_degree)
median(in_degree)
```

Again, most participants received a reply from small number of
individuals.

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Use the code chunk below to examine the distribution, mean and median of
`out_degree`:

```{r}

```

In the space below, write your interpretation of these results.

### Edge Weights

Finally, let's also take a look at the distribution, mean and median of
the edge weights we added to our graph.

Recall from earlier that the {igraph} package has a unique syntax for
accessing node and edge attributes. For edges we use `E()` and included
the name of the network object we want to use, followed by the `$`
operator to select the attribute.

```{r}
weights <- E(weighted_network)$weight

hist(weights, breaks = 10)
mean(weights)
median(weights)

```

It looks like the vast majority or participants either sent or received
a reply from just one other participant.

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

The use of the `$` is actually standard across R and a very useful
operator.

Use the code chunk below to create a histogram and calculate the mean
and median from the edge weighs created earlier in the [Add Edge
Weights] section by using the `edge_weights` data frame, the `$`
operator, and column `n` which contains the counts for each unique edge.

```{r}

```

Are these results consistent with our summary of edge weights we created
above?

## 3b. Make a Sociogram

If you recall from our [1a. Review the Research] section, one of the
defining characteristics of the social network perspective is its use of
graphic imagery to represent actors and their relations with one
another. To emphasize this point, Carolyn (2013) reported that:

> The visualization of social networks has been a core practice since
> its foundation more than 90 years ago and remains a hallmark of
> contemporary social network analysis. 

Network visualization can be used for a variety of purposes, ranging
from highlighting key actors to even serving as works of art. This
excellent figure from Katya Ognyanova's also excellent tutorial on
[Static and Dynamic Network Visualization with
R](https://kateto.net/network-visualization/) helps illustrate the
variety of goals a good network visualization can accomplish:

![](img/viz-goals.jpeg){width="80%"}

These visual representations of the actors and their relations, i.e. the
network, are called a sociogram. Actors who are most central to the
network, such as those with higher node degrees, are usually placed in
the center of the sociogram and their ties are placed near them. As
we'll see in just a bit, those two actors with hundreds of ties will be
placed by most graph layout algorithms in the center of the graph.

For Unit 1, we'll be using the `plot()` function from R's built in
{graphics} package to make a sociogram.

Let's run the code and see what we get without any tweaking and see what
the plot function produces:

```{r}
plot(weighted_network)

```

If this had been a smaller network like one generated from a teacher
professional development workshop, this might have been useful, but for
large networks like our MOOC-Ed discussion forums, this doesn't
communicate much. In fact, it's visualizations like these that give
sociograms the unflattering nickname of "hair ball" plots.

Fortunately, the {igraph} package includes a [plethora of plotting
parameters](https://igraph.org/r/doc/plot.common.html) for improving the
layout and visual design of network graphs!

There are many ways to modify vertices and edges in a sociogram to
improve readability. Up to four attributes of each actor can be layered
onto the sociogram by altering the color, shape, label, and size of the
symbol. And attributes for edges can be represented in a range of ways
as well.

### Remove Labels

One quick fix is to simply remove the labels by adding the
`vertex.label =` argument and setting it to `NA`.

Since the number labels don't provide much useful information, let's go
ahead and remove them:

```{r}
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA)
```

We can now at least see the nodes, or vertices, but with 445
participants in the forums, many are masked by the default size of each
node.

### Change vertex size

By default, the size of nodes is 15. Let's add the `vertex.size =`
argument and change that to 1:

```{r}
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = 1)
```

A little better, but let's use the `node_degree` we calculated to
emphasize those wiht greater connections in the course by substitute
`node_degree` for a specific value.

```{r}
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = node_degree)
```

Whoops! This certainly emphasizes the disproportionate number of ties
among these two participants, but not quite what we're going for.

Since `node_degree` is just a list of values for each node we can treat
it like a number. Let's divide that by 10 to reduce the relative size:

```{r}
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = node_degree/10)
```

That's better, and helps highlight our two main actors without
overshadowing the rest, but those arrows are definitely an eyesore.

### Reduce arrow size

Let's add the `edge.arrow.size =` argument and dramatically reduce:

```{r}
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = node_degree*.1,
     edge.arrow.size = .04)
```

Much better, now let's deal with the size of the edges.

#### Adjust Edge Width

We can add the `edge.width =` argument to help minimize edge overlap yet
still make them visible. This is a bit of trial and error but let's give
.2 a try since the default is 1:

```{r}
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = node_degree*.05,
     edge.arrow.size = .04,
     edge.width = .2)
```

Note that we could also set `edge.with =` to the weight of each edge,
similar to how we used degree for the size of each node.

Let's give that a try:

```{r}
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = node_degree*.1,
     edge.arrow.size = .04,
     edge.width = E(weighted_network)$weight)
```

Not much of an improvement, if at all, given how many edges are in our
network.

Let's try dividing that weight by 5 similar to reduce like with did with
the `vertex.size =` argument:

```{r}
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = node_degree*.05,
     edge.arrow.size = .05,
     edge.width = E(weighted_network)$weight/5)
```

Better, but since we know most edges have a weight of 1 there really
isn't too much to work with here.

Let's move on to changing graph layout!

#### Change Layout

One of the major advances in visualization since the first hand-drawn
sociograms developed by Jacob Moreno (1934) to represent relations among
children in school is the use of software and algorithms to
automatically layout networks on a grid.

There are may different [layout
methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing#Layout_methods),
but we'll start with the Fruchterman-Reingold (FR) layout, which is one
of the most used layout algorithms for network visualization. These
types of force-directed algorithms generally work well with large
networks and try to layout graphs in "an aesthetically-pleasing way" by
making edges roughly equal in length and minimizing overlap.

Let give the FR layout a try by using the `layout =` argument and
specifying `layout_with_fr`:

```{r}
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = node_degree*.05,
     edge.arrow.size = .05,
     edge.width = E(weighted_network)$weight/5,
     layout = layout_with_fr)
```

By default, {igraph} uses `layout_nicely`, a smart function that chooses
a layout based on the graph. Given the similarity with our previous
graph, I'm assuming it chose the the FR layout as well.

Let's try one more just for fun:

```{r}

plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = node_degree*.05,
     edge.arrow.size = .05,
     edge.width = E(weighted_network)$weight/5,
     layout = layout_in_circle)

```

Interesting but not terribly useful!

There are many other [igraph layout
functions](https://igraph.org/r/doc/layout_.html), some more useful than
others depending on the context. We've only scratched the surface of
what's possible with network plotting but hopefully this have given you
a sense of what required to avoid the dreaded "hair ball" plot and
create a network viz that communicates something useful.

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Try modifying the code below by tweaking the included
arguments/parameters or adding new arguments/parameters to make our plot
either more "aesthetically pleasing" or more purposeful in what it's
trying to communicate.

You're also welcome to try out some of the other graphing options from
from Katya Ognyanova's tutorial on [Static and Dynamic Network
Visualization with R](https://kateto.net/network-visualization/).

There are no right or wrong answers, just have some fun trying out
different approaches!

```{r}
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = node_degree*.05,
     edge.arrow.size = .05,
     edge.width = E(weighted_network)$weight/5,
     layout = layout_with_fr)
```

# 4. MODEL

As highlighted in [Chapter 3 of Data Science in Education Using
R](https://datascienceineducation.com/c03.html), the **Model** step of
the data science process entails "using statistical models, from simple
to complex, to understand trends and patterns in the data." The authors
note that while descriptive statistics and data visualization during
the **Explore** step can help us to identify patterns and relationships
in our data, statistical models can be used to help us determine if
relationships, patterns and trends are actually meaningful.

We will not explore the use of models for SNA until Unit 3, but recall
from [A Social Network Perspective in MOOC-Eds] was guided by the
following questions:

1.  What are the patterns of peer interaction and the structure of peer
    networks that emerge over the course of a MOOC-Ed?

2.  To what extent do participant and network attributes (e.g.,
    homophily, reciprocity, transitivity) account for the structure of
    these networks?

3.  To what extent do these networks result in the co-construction of
    new knowledge?

To address Question 1, actors in the network were categorized into
distinct mutually exclusive groups using the core-periphery and regular
equivalence functions of UCINET. The former used the CORR algorithm to
divide the network into actors that are part of a densely connected
subgroup, or "core", from those that are part of the sparsely connected
periphery. Regular equivalence employs the REGE blockmodeling algorithm
to partition, or group, actors in the network based on the similarity of
their ties to others with similar ties. In essence, blockmodeling
provides a systematic way for categorizing educators based on the ways
in which they interacted with peers.

As we saw upon just a basic visual inspection of our network during the
Explore section, there was a small core of highly connected participants
surrounded by those on the "periphery," or edge, of the network with
very few connections. In the DLT 2 course, those on the periphery made
up roughly 90% of network! The study also found relatively high levels
of reciprocation, but also found that roughly a quarter of participants
were characterized as "brodcasters" -- educators who initiated a
discussion thread, but neither reciprocated with those who replied, nor
posted to threads initiated by others.

To address Question 2, this study use the exponential family of random
graph models (ERGM; also known as p\* models), which provide a
statistical approach to network modeling that addresses the complex
dependencies within networks. ERGMs predict network ties and determine
the statistical likelihood of a given network structure, based on an
assumed dependency structure, the attributes of the individuals (e.g.,
gender, popularity, location, previous ties) and prior states of the
network.

### **👉 Your Turn** **⤵**

Recall from the [1a. Review the Research] that you were asked to
identify two "node attributes" from the dataset that might be useful for
predicting participants who may be more engaged or central to the
network.

Take look at page 276 of [A social network perspective on peer supported
learning in MOOCs for
educators](https://github.com/sbkellogg/eci-589/blob/main/unit-1/lit/sna_mooc_irrodl_bjet_articles.pdf).
Were your predictions correct?

# 5. COMMUNICATE

The final step in our workflow/process is sharing the results of
analysis with wider a audience. Krumm et al. (2018) have outline the
following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders
what you have learned through analysis:

1.  **Select**. Communicating what one has learned involves selecting
    among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an
    intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that
    information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form,
    i.e. a "data product."

2.  **Polish**. After creating initial versions of data products,
    research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by
    adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with
    colors and shapes to highlight key points.

3.  **Narrate**. Writing a narrative to accompany the data products
    involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related
    research question, describing how best to interpret the data
    product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps
    answer the research question.

For your Independent Analysis assignment for Unit 1 next week, you'll be
creating either a simple report or slide deck using an R Markdown
document just like this to share out some key findings from our
analysis. Regardless of whether you plan to talk us through your
analysis and findings with a presentation or walk us through with a
brief written report, your presentation or report should address the
following questions:

1.  **Purpose**. What question or questions are guiding your analysis?
    What did you hope to learn by answering these questions and why
    should your audience care about your findings?

2.  **Methods**. What data did you selected for analysis? What steps did
    you take took to prepare your data for analysis and what techniques
    you used to analyze your data? These should be fairly explicit with
    your embedded code.

3.  **Findings**. What did you ultimately find? How do your "data
    products" help to illustrate these findings? What conclusions can
    you draw from your analysis?

4.  **Discussion**. What were some of the strengths and weaknesses of
    your analysis? How might your audience use this information? How
    might you revisit or improve upon this analysis in the future?
