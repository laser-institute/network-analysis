## 1. Prepare

Our *Unit 2 Case Study: Collaboration Ties over Time* revisits the
research of Dr. Alan Daly and centers around the impact No Child Left
Behind reform efforts on school and district leadership networks. In
this unit we move beyond visual depictions of networks from our previous
SNA case study and learn to describe networks using common network-level
measures. Our analyses are guided by research conducted by Daly and
Finnagan @daly2011ebb who examined the ebb and flow of social network
ties between district leaders under high-stakes accountability. As we
work through each step of the data-intensive workflow [@krumm2018], we
will focus on the following topics:

1.  **Prepare**: Prior to analysis, we'll take a look at the context
    from which our data came and load various R packages for data
    science and network analysis.

2.  **Wrangle**: In section 2 we once make use of the {readxl} and
    {tidygraph} packages to import and prepare relational data stored as
    as an adjacency matrix.

3.  **Explore**: In our prior case study, we indirectly used the
    {igraph} package on which {tidygraph} depends. In section 3, we use
    {igraph} directly to calculate a range of network-level measures to
    describe and compare collaboration networks over time.

4.  **Model**: While we don't do any modeling of our data in this case
    study, we dive a little deeper into work of Daly and Finnagan
    @daly2011ebb to see how modeling can be used to examine longitudinal
    network data.

5.  **Communicate**: Finally, we prepare a simple "data product"
    consisting of a data visualization and/or table that highlights some
    key findings from our analysis.

### 1a. Review the Research

network ties between district leaders under high-stakes accountability.
*American Educational Research Journal*, *48*(1), 39-79.

#### Abstract

Recent scholarship suggests the importance of school district offices in
supporting reform. These studies provide strategies for building
relations between central offices and sites in order to improve change
efforts. However, what is frequently overlooked is that organizational
reform efforts are socially constructed. Therefore, examining the
underlying reform-related social networks may provide insight into how
relational structures support or constrain efforts at reform. This
longitudinal case study draws upon social network analysis and
interviews to examine the reform-related knowledge, advice, and
innovation network structures of central office and site leaders in a
district facing sanction for underperformance and engaging a
districtwide reform. Findings indicate that over time, the networks
increased the number of superficial interactions, and more frequent
exchanges remained unchanged, resulting in a centralized network
structure.

### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

Take a look at the article *The Ebb and Flow of Social Network Ties
Between District Leaders Under High-Stakes Accountability* located in
the lit folder of your files pane and answer the following questions:

1.  What research questions were the authors of this study trying to
    address and why did they consider these questions important?

    -   

2.  How were participants selected for this study and what was the
    rationale?

    -   

3.  How did the authors collect social network data for this study and
    what specific information about actors and ties were collected?

    -   

### 1b. Load Libraries

Recall that R [**packages**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_package),
sometimes referred to as libraries, are shareable collections of R code
that can contain functions, data, and/or documentation and extend the
functionality of R. Before loading an R package, you must first make
sure it has been installed in your environment. You can always check to
see which packages have already been installed and loaded into RStudio
Cloud by looking at the the Files, Plots, & Packages Pane in the lower
right hand corner.

#### Core SNA Packages

**tidygraph 📦**

![](img/tidygraph.png){width="20%"}

The {[tidygraph](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/)} package is a
huge package that exports 280 different functions and methods, including
access to almost all of the `dplyr` verbs plus a few more, developed for
use with relational data. While network data itself is not tidy, it can
be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge
data. The {tidygraph} package provides a way to switch between the two
tables and uses `dplyr` verbs to manipulate them. Furthermore it
provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that
facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.

**ggraph 📦**

![](img/ggraph.png){width="20%"}

Created by the same developer as {tidygraph},
{[ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html)} -- pronounced
gg-raph or g-giraffe hence the logo -- is an extension of
{[ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)} aimed at supporting
relational data structures such as networks, graphs, and trees. Both
packages are more modern and widely adopted approaches data
visualization in R.

While ggraph builds upon the foundation of ggplot and its API, it comes
with its own self-contained set of geoms, facets, etc., as well as
adding the concept of *layouts* to the [grammar of
graphics](https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html?q=grammar#what-is-the-grammar-of-graphics),
i.e. the "gg" in ggplot and ggraph.

**igraph 📦**

![](img/igraph.png){width="20%"}

Both {tidygraph} and {ggraph} depend heavily [igraph network analysis
package](https://igraph.org/). The main goals of the igraph package and
the collection of network analysis tools it contains are to provide a
set of data types and functions for:

1.  pain-free implementation of graph algorithms,

2.  fast handling of large graphs, with millions of vertices (i.e.,
    actors or nodes) and edges,

3.  allowing rapid prototyping via high level languages like R.

#### New Packages

**readxl 📦**

![](img/readxl.png){width="20%"}

The [{readxl}](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) package makes it easy to
get data out of Excel and into R. Compared to many of the existing
packages (e.g. gdata, xlsx, xlsReadWrite) readxl has no external
dependencies, so it's easy to install and use on all operating systems.
It is designed to work with *tabular* data.

Since one of our data wrangling steps in the next section is importing
network matrices stored in excel files, this package will come in handy.

### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

Use the code chunk below to load the tidyverse, igraph, tidygraph,
ggraph, and readxl packages that we'll be using in this case study:

```{r libraries}
# YOUR CODE HERE



```

## 2. Wrangle

In general, data wrangling involves some combination of cleaning,
reshaping, transforming, and merging data[@wickham2016r]. As highlighted
in Estrellado et al. @estrellado2020e, wrangling network data can be
even more challenging than other data sources since network data often
includes variables about both individuals and their relationships. For
data wrangling in this unit, we're keeping it simple since working with
relational data, especially in the form of matrices, is a bit of a
departure from our working with rectangular data frames.

### 2a. Import Data

One of our primary goals for this case study is to examine how
collaboration networks among school and district leaders changed over
time. To do so, we'll need to import two Excel files from the [Social
Network Analysis and Education companion
site](https://studysites.sagepub.com/carolan/study/resources.htm). Both
files contain edges stored as a square matrix (more on this later) for
the first and third year of a study examining the impact of national
reform efforts [@daly2011ebb].

These files are included in the data folder of your R Studio project. A
description of each file from the companion website is linked above and
each data file is linked below:

1.  [**year_1\_collaboration.xlsx**](https://studysites-sagepub-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/carolan/study/materials/datasets/99472_ds7.xls)
    This adjacency matrix reports on "collaboration" ties among 43
    school leaders in year 1 of a three-year study. This is a directed
    valued (weighted) network measured on five-point scale ranging from
    0 to 4, with higher values indicating more frequent collaborations
    (1--2 times/week). These data are used throughout Chapter 9.

2.  [**year_3\_collaboration.xlsx**](https://studysites-sagepub-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/carolan/study/materials/datasets/99472_ds8.xlsx)
    This adjacency matrix reports on "collaboration" ties among 43
    school leaders in year 3 of a three-year study. This is a directed
    valued (weighted) network measured on five-point scale ranging from
    0 to 4, with higher values indicating more frequent collaborations
    (1--2 times/week). 

Recall from above that our relations, or edges, are stored as a valued
[adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) in
which columns and rows consist of the same actors and each cell contains
information about the tie between each pair of actors. In our case, the
tie is a directed and valued "arc" where the value indicates the
frequency of collaboration.

Let's use the `read_excel()` function to import the
`year_1_collaboration.xlsx` file, add an argument setting the column
names to `FALSE` since our file is a simple matrix with no header or
column names, and assign the matrix to a variable named
`year_1_collaboration`:

**R Studio Tip:** Type `?read_excel` into the console and check the
arguments section to examine the different arguments that can be used
with this function.

```{r import year }

year_1_collaboration <- read_excel("data/year_1_collaboration.xlsx", 
                            col_names = FALSE)
```

Before importing our Year 3 file, let's quickly inspect the R object we
just imported to see what we'll be working with.

```{r year_1_view}

year_1_collaboration

```

As you can see, we have a 43 x 43
"[tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org)" or data table representing our
collaboration ties. In Section 2, we'll learn how to restructure this
data into a formal matrix and then convert to a network class R object
so we can explore our data through network visualization and analyses.

### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

Use the code chunk below to import the Year 3 collaboration network
located in data folder of your R project and then inspect your newly
created object to make sure it imported as expected.

```{r year_3_import}
#YOUR CODE HERE


```

### 2b. Create a Tidy Graph

As noted above, before we can begin exploring our data through through
network visualization and analysis, we must first restructure our data
into a formal matrix and then convert to a network class R object
required by the igraph, tidygraph, and ggraph packages.

However, one thing you may have noticed from our inspection of the data
above is that our data table is missing the names of the school leaders
in our network, which are needed for determining dyads in our network. R
has packages for creating random names to help anonymize data, but to
keep things simple, we'll just assign the numbers 1-43 as names for our
rows and columns.

```{r assign_names}

rownames(year_1_collaboration) <- 1:43

colnames(year_1_collaboration) <- 1:43

```

You may have seen a warning stating:
`Setting row names on a tibble is deprecated.` You can ignore that for
now but it's basically telling us these functions are old we we need to
use newer function or our code will some day stop working.

Again, let quickly inspect our `year_1_collaboration` data table to see
if this worked:

```{r}
year_1_collaboration
```

As you can see, we now have names for our rows and columns corresponding
to each school leader in our network. So we can see that leader 1
collaborated with leader 3 and with a frequency of "3" but obviously did
not collaborate with 2 as indicated by the "0" in the corresponding
cell. Note that leader 3 also indicated that they collaborated with 1,
but on a slightly more frequent basis as indicated by the "4" in the
corresponding cell.

#### Convert to Matrix Object

Now that we have names included for our rows and columns, we need to
convert our data table, or tibble, to a formal matrix class object. To
do so is relatively simple using the `as.matrix()` function built into
R.

```{r as_matrix}

year_1_matrix <- as.matrix(year_1_collaboration )

```

The word "class" and "object" have been used quite a bit in this
case-study and warrant a brief explanation. Classes and objects are
basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming environments like R. An
**object** is simply a data structure that has some methods and
attributes. Everything in R is essentially an object. A **class** is
just a blueprint or a sketch of these objects. It represents the set of
properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.

Let's use the `class()` function on the `year_1_collaboration` and
`year_1_matrix` to see the types of objects we just created:

```{r object_class}

class(year_1_collaboration)

class(year_1_matrix)

```

Great! We can now see that our `year_1_matrix` is formally an object of
the "matrix" class.

#### Convert to Graph Object

Our final step before we're able to begin exploring our data is to
convert our matrix to a network object recognized by the {igraph} and
{tidygraph} packages.
The [`as_tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) function
can easily convert relational data from all common network data formats
such as matrices,
`network`, `phylo`, `dendrogram`, `data.tree`, `graph`, etc. 

Run the following code to convert our matrix to directed network graph
and save as a new object called `year_1_network`:

```{r}

year_1_network <- as_tbl_graph(year_1_matrix, directed = TRUE)

```

Again, let's inspect our new object:

```{r year_1_network}

year_1_network

```

As you can see, our `year_1_network` provides a range of information
about out network including network size, type, number of components,
and a preview of the node and edge lists that it created. The node and
edge lists are treated just like a typical data frame and can now be
used with other tidyverse packages and functions to create new
actor-level network variables like degree, reciprocity, and centrality
measures.

### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

Use the code chunk below to complete the following data wrangling steps
for our Year 3 collaboration network from the Excel file you imported
earlier:

1.  Add row and column names to the data frame;

2.  Convert the resulting data frame to a matrix class object and check
    to confirm that it is indeed a matrix;

3.  Convert the matrix to a network graphs object with directed edges;

4.  Inspect the Year 3 collaboration network and answer the questions
    after the code chunk.

```{r}
#YOUR CODE HERE



```

1.  What is the size of the Year 3 collaboration network?

    -   

2.  How many components are in this network?

    -   

3.  How many nodes and edges variables are in our tidy graph and what
    does each variable (e.g., weight) represent?

    inferences might you already be able to make just based on the size
    of the two networks?

## 3. Explore

Relevant to our case study of school leader collaboration, Carolyn notes
in SNA and Education @carolan2014 that:

> ... to address questions that probe a network's dynamics (i.e., its
> change over time), it is necessary to first figure out what the
> network looks like at one point in time, what is commonly referred to
> as the network's topography.

In order to describe a network's **topography**, social network
researchers utilize an array of algorithms and indices to describe both
visually and numerically different characteristics of social networks.
These algorithms and indices rely on both simple and somewhat
sophisticated mathematical computation.

In this section we revisit the {tidygraph} and {ggraph} packages for
creating sociograms and computing basic node and edge-level measures,
and then introduce some key functions from the {igraph} package for
obtaining complete network-level measures.

### 3a. Visually Describe the Network

One of the defining characteristics of the social network perspective is
its use of graphic imagery to represent actors and their relations with
one another. To emphasize this point, Carolyn (2013) reported that:

> The visualization of social networks has been a core practice since
> its foundation more than 90 years ago and remains a hallmark of
> contemporary social network analysis. 

Network visualization can be used for a variety of purposes, ranging
from highlighting key actors to even serving as works of art. Katya
Ognyanova's also excellent tutorial on [Static and Dynamic Network
Visualization with R](https://kateto.net/network-visualization/) helps
illustrate the variety of goals a good network visualization can
accomplish.

Recall from our previous SNA case study examining Twitter networks
surrounding the Common Core State Standards that we introduced the dead
simple
[`plot()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/plot)
function built into R to quickly generate a sociogram showing the nodes
and edges in our network.

Let's supply our `year-1-network` object as the first argument of this
function and see what it produces:

```{r plot}

plot(year_1_network)

```

While not the most aesthetically pleasing plot, it definitely is
functional. As indicated by our tidy graph output from section 1, we can
see that there is one large network component and two additional
components consisting of isolated school leaders with no collaboration
ties.

If this had been a larger network with more nodes and edges, however,
the utility of the basic `plot()` function would evaporate quickly. For
example, try this function out with the Year 3 network in the console
and see what it produces.

Fortunately, the {ggraph} package includes a plethora of plotting
parameters for graph layouts, edges and nodes to improve the visual
design and readability of network graphs.

**Note:** If you're having trouble seeing the plot you can run the code
in the console and see the plot in the Viewer pane or click the little
arrow/window icon in the output of the code chunk to open the plot in a
new window and resize.

### **Sociograms with ggraph**

One thing to keep in mind when building a network viz with the {ggraph}
package is that just like it's {ggplot} counterpart for making more
traditional charts and graphs, there is a minimal code template for
producing a basic plot. Specifically, ggraph requires 3 main functions

-   [`ggraph()`](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Layouts.html)
    takes care of setting up the plot object along with creating the
    layout of the graph (default = "stress").

-   [`geom_node_*()`](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Layouts.html)
    functions and their associated arguments add and modify the nodes of
    the network plot.

-   [`geom_edge_*()`](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/articles/Edges.html)
    functions and their associated arguments add and modify the edgez of
    the network plot.

Like the basic plotting function above, ggraph has a similar
`autograph()` function for automatically generating a simple sociogram
to get a quick snapshot of your network. Run the following code
supplying our `year_1_network` object as the first argument for this
function:

```{r autograph}

autograph(year_1_network)

```

As you can see, this produces a very basic plot that includes our
network nodes and edges with minimal styling.

Within this function, however, are the three core functions noted above
that can be modified though different arguments or by adding additional
layers of functions to change the visual aesthetics of your sociogram to
highlight key characteristics of the network, like edge weight or
central actors.

Let generate the same basic plot above but explicitly call our ggraph,
node, and edge functions:

```{r}

ggraph(year_1_network) +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_edge_link()

```

We won't spend a lot of time on polishing our graph here. We'll save
that effort for when we are ready to communicate our findings to a
specific audience, but lets make some quick functional and aesthetic
changes: Run the following code to:

-   Change the graph layout to the Fruchterman-Reingold (FR) layout
    using the `layout = "fr"` argument to help highlight areas of
    clustering;

-   Change the size of our nodes using the `size = 3` argument to make
    them more visible;

-   Add color to our edges based using the `aes(colour = weight)`
    argument to highlight more frequent collaborations; and,

-   Add the `theme_graph()` layer to remove the gray background.

```{r}

ggraph(year_1_network, layout = "fr") +
  geom_node_point(size = 3) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = weight)) +
  theme_graph()
  

```

That is perhaps slightly better, but before sharing with an education
partner, I would likely do quite a bit more clean up to highlight key
findings specific to network measures that we'll explore in the next
section. For example, I might change the size of nodes for school
leaders based on measures of centralization to highlight more central
actors in the network and add arrows to indicate directionality of the
ties since this is a directed network.

### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

Use the code chunk below created a simple sociogram for the Year 3
collaboration network and answer the questions that follow:

```{r year_3_sociogram}

    are some similarities and differences?

### 3b. Describe the Network Mathematically

This section include some of the most common measures used to describe
the features of complete networks, as well was .

> Network-level structural measures are those that are calculated from
> the entire network. Therefore, they provide an excellent snapshot of
> the network's structure---the pattern of relations among the network's
> actors.

In addition to providing an overall summary of the network, these
measures provide a concrete means to compare relations such as whether
the friendship, social support, and advice seeking networks within the
same fraternity, for example, are comparable. In our case study, for
example, were are

#### 1. Network Size

One simple but important property of a social network is its size, or
the number of nodes and edges in a network. As Carolan notes:

> Size plays an important role in determining what happens in the
> network--- what resources are exchanged among actors, for example...
> Size affects other network measures, but on a conceptual level, it
> influences the structure of relations, as actors only have so many
> resources and capacities for creating and maintaining ties with
> others.

As we saw in the previous section, the `year_1_network` output provided
us with basic information about our networks size, including the number
of nodes and edges in our network. The {igraph} package also has some
basic functions for retrieving the number of nodes and edges in a
network.

Run the following code chunk to use the
[`gorder()`](https://igraph.org/r/html/latest/gorder.html) and
[`gsize()`](https://igraph.org/r/html/latest/gsize.html) functions
obtain the number of vertices and edges respectively:

```{r size}

gorder(year_1_network)

gsize(year_1_network)

```

#### 2. Centralization

A key structural property of complete networks, and often the focus of
network studies is the concept of centralization, or the extent to which
relations are focused on one or a small set of actors. Centralization is
an important concept in network because, as Carolan notes:

> Central actors likely wield a disproportionate amount of influence on
> the network. Therefore, high centralization provides fewer actors with
> more power and control.

Centralization can be based on a number of different measures, but
degree is one of the most common. Degree refers to the number of ties an
actor either sends (out-degree), receives (in-degree), or in the case of
a non-directed network or both sent and received in a directed network,
simply just "degree" for all actors to which one is connected.

The
[`centr_degree()`](https://igraph.org/r/html/latest/centr_degree.html)
function in {igraph} provides a centralization score based on the metric
selected, as well as the degree for each actors in the network. Let's
first take a look at the centralization measure based on number of
actors individuals have ties with regardless of directionality:

```{r}
centr_degree(year_1_network, mode = "all")
```

The first variable `$res` provides node-level centrality scores. So for
example, the first school leader in our network is connected to 5 other
actors in the network. The `$centralization` variable provides our
actual centrality score, which is quite small suggesting a very
decentralized network. And the final `$theoretical_max` provides the
maximum theoretical graph level centralization score for our graph based
on the number of vertices.

Let's also take a quick look at centralization scores for in-degree and
out-degree:

```{r}
centr_degree(year_1_network, mode = "out")
centr_degree(year_1_network, mode = "in")
```

Again, we still have a very decentralize graph, though slightly more
centralized around in-degree.

While our primary concern is complete network-level measures so we can
compare Year 1 & 3 networks, obtaining node-level measures is also very
useful for helping to describe the network, particularly for
visualization. For example, we might want to adjust the size of nodes in
a network based on degree, so those actors with more connections stand
out more prominently.

The {tidygraph} package has an unique function called `activate()` that
allows us to treat the nodes and edges in our network object as if they
were a standard data frame that we can then apply standard tidyverse
functions to like `select()`, `filter()`, and `mutate()`.

The latter function, `mutate()`, can be use to create new variables for
node-level measures of degree, in-degree, and out-degree using the
`centrality_degree()` function in the {tidygraph} package.

Run the following code to add each actor's degree to our Year 1
collaboration network and assign the output `year_1_network` again so
the results are saved:

```{r node_degree}
year_1_network <- year_1_network |>
  activate(nodes) |>
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(mode = "all"))

year_1_network

```

Now we could adjust the size of more central actors in our sociogram
from above like so to highlight the full range of collaboration ties in
our network:

```{r}
ggraph(year_1_network) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree, color = degree)) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(color = weight)) +
  theme_graph()
```

#### 3. Density

Since we know the number of ties, or edges, in our network, we can
examine the overall density of our network, which is directly linked to
network size. As Carolan explains:

> Density refers to the number of ties in the network reported as a
> fraction of the total possible number of ties... The closer this
> number is to 1.0, the denser the network.

The igraph packages has two different function for calculating the
density of a network,
[`edge_density()`](https://igraph.org/r/html/latest/edge_density.html)
and
[`graph.density()`](https://igraph.org/r/html/latest/edge_density.html),
but both yield the exact same result. The `edge_density()` function is
the more recent function and should be used, but let's try them both
out:

```{r}

edge_density(year_1_network)

graph.density(year_1_network)
```

As you can see, our collaboration network in Year 1 has a VERY low
density, which suggests that collaboration in this network is quite
limited and may impact the flow of information, resources, and
innovations among school leaders.

#### 4. Reciprocity

Reciprocity is an important measure because it reveals the direction
through which resources in networks flow and whether or not it flows in
both directions. The tendency towards reciprocity in most networks,
sometimes referred to as the "norm" of reciprocity, has been acknowledge
by ancient writers such as Cicero who stated:

> There is no duty more indispensable than that of returning a
> kindness... all men distrust one forgetful of a benefit.

At the network-level, reciprocity is defined as reciprocity is **a
measure of the likelihood of vertices in a directed network to be
mutually linked**. Using the
[`reciprocity()`](https://igraph.org/r/html/latest/reciprocity.html)
function, we can directly calculate this measure:

```{r reciprocity}

reciprocity(year_1_network)
```

As illustrated by the reciprocity measure above, the tendency towards
reciprocated collaboration ties is, surprisingly, very low in our Year 1
network.

And if we wanted to highlight this lack of reciprocity in a network
visual, we could use the
[`edge_is_mutual()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/edge_types.html)
function to create a new edge variable called `reciprocated` that
indicates whether the tie is mutual or asymmetric.

```{r}

year_1_network <- year_1_network |>
  activate(edges) |>
  mutate(reciprocated = edge_is_mutual())

year_1_network
```

As shown in the output above, the tie between school leader 1 and 3 is
reciprocated, but the tie between 3 and 24 is not.

Let's now add this new variable to our sociogram to highlight
reciprocated ties in our Year 1 network:

```{r}
ggraph(year_1_network) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree)) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(color = reciprocated)) +
  theme_graph()
```

As you can see, there only appear to be seven dyads with reciprocated
ties!

#### 5. Transitivity & Clustering

Transitivity, also known as the "friend of a friend" phenomenon, focuses
on triads, or any "triple" of actors, rather than dyads like
reciprocity. Just like a networks tendency towards reciprocity, there is
also a tendency toward transitivity. For example, in the figure below
Teacher A collaborates with Teacher B and Teacher B collaborates with
Teacher C, then Teacher A is more likely at some point to collaborates
with Teacher C and "complete" the triangle and less likely to
collaborate with Teacher E since they do now share a connection:

As Carolan points out, establishing a network's transitivity is
important, as it is theoretically connected to actors' tendencies to
divide into exclusive subgroups or cluster over time, especially around
positive relations such as friendship. While the algorithms behind
network transitivity are not trivial, the defining network transitivity
is rather straightforward:

> Transitivity measures the probability that the adjacent vertices of a
> vertex are connected. This is sometimes also called the clustering
> coefficient.

The
[`transitivity()`](https://igraph.org/r/html/latest/transitivity.html)
function provides a convenient means to calculate a network-level
transitive measures:

```{r transitivity}

transitivity(year_1_network)
```

For our particular network, a relatively small value of 24.4% is not too
surprising since this is the start of the research study and since the
density of our network overall is very low.

#### 6. Diameter & Distance

Whereas transitivity focuses on the importance of certain configurations
of triads, diameter and distance are more straightforward. A network's
diameter simply refers to the longest path between any two actors. A
related measure is the average path length, which measures the mean
distance between all pairs of actors in the network.

The two functions for computing diameter and average path length are
`diameter()` and `mean_distance()` respectively. Let's apply both of
these to our `year_1_network` object:

```{r diameter_distance}

diameter(year_1_network)

mean_distance(year_1_network)

```

Carolan notes that both diameter and average path length are important
network-level structural properties. Similar to diameter and distance
measures for our Year 1 network above, he notes that a network with a
large diameter and small average path length suggests a structure in
which there are parts of the network that some network actors may be
unable to access.

1.  How do network-level measures for Year 1 and Year 3 collaboration
    compare? What are some similarities and differences?

    -   

2.  What do these measures suggest about changes in collaboration among
    school leaders over time? In your response, cite some specific
    measures from Year 1 & 3 as evidence for your conclusions.

## 4. Model

A developing area of network research is the advancement of statistical
models and tools to examine network change over time [@carolan2014].
These models are used to empirically test if changes in key structure
measures are statistically significant, and also explain potential
mechanisms driving those changes. Stochastic actor-based models, for
example, are a family of models that have the purpose of representing
network dynamics on the basis of observed longitudinal data. These
stochastic actor-based models allow users to test hypotheses about these
tendencies toward reciprocity, homophily, and transitivity over time and
to estimate parameters expressing their strengths while controlling for
other tendencies ("confounders").

### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

Take a look at the article *The Ebb and Flow of Social Network Ties
Between District Leaders Under High-Stakes Accountability* located in
the lit folder of your files pane and answer the following questions:

1.  What model(s) did Daly and Finnagan use in their longitudinal case
    study to examine changes in reform-related knowledge, advice, and
    innovation network structures?

    -   

2.  What findings about network changes (list 2-3) did you find most
    interesting and why?

    -   

## 5. Communicate

The final step in our workflow/process is sharing the results of our
analysis with wider audience. Krumm et al. (2018) have outlined the
following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders
findings from an analysis:

1.  **Select.** Communicating what one has learned involves selecting
    among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an
    intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that
    information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form,
    i.e. a "data product."

2.  **Polish**. After creating initial versions of data products,
    research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by
    adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with
    colors and shapes to highlight key points.

3.  **Narrate.** Writing a narrative to accompany the data products
    involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related
    research question, describing how best to interpret the data
    product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps
    answer the research question.

### 👉 Your Turn ⤵

For your final Your Turn, your goal is to distill our analysis from
above into a simple "data product" designed to illustrate key findings
about changes in the collaboration network over time. For the purposes
of this task, imagine that your audience consists of state-level
education policy makers with limited background in SNA and adapt the
following steps accordingly:

1.  **Select.** Select a few network-level measures that you think would
    be interesting or relevant for your target audience and that help
    answer our research questions.

2.  **Polish.** Create and polish a data visualization and/or data table
    to communicate your selected findings.

3.  **Narrate.** Write a brief narrative (2-3 paragraphs) to accompany
    your visualization and/or table that includes the following:

    -   The question or questions are guiding your analysis;

    -   The conclusions you've reached based on your analyses and
        findings;

    -   How your audience might use this information;

    -   How you might revisit or improve upon this analysis in the
        future.

Use the code chunk below create a polished table or visualization(s) and
write a brief narrative in the space that follows.
